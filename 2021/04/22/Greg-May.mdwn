My mother Ute Hendry met Greg in 1972 through his boutique "Mad Yak" in Durban.
A _hippie_ shop of hand made goods.

He offered my mother her first job in South Africa at 18 years old, and Greg
was just a year older. He suggested <a
href="https://s.natalian.org/2021-04-22/sari.jpeg">making "hippie" women's
clothing out of Indian Saris</a>. So together they went to Grey street where
all the Indian shops are, to buy cloth to make dresses.

My mother and an Indian machinist made the clothes in a hippie commune in
Malvern near Queensburgh where many travellers congregated. Greg's mother Wynne
May, an author for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills_%26_Boon">Mills
& Boom</a> used to visit in horror. Lets not forget why young travellers were
in Durban in those days.

Two years later Greg was conscripted to the South African army, and he handed
the business to a man named "Smokey" who my mother didn't like to work for.

When Greg came out of the army, and he turned up at "Gandalf's Garden", a new
shop my mother and Marilyn operated their businesses from, my mother claims she
didn't recognise him! They weren't friends then, since before he was her boss.

Greg then focused on cameras and later he had his own advertising company. We
all remember Greg as an incredible creative, where he was able to combine all
his talents. He was very well read and had an immense music collection.

Our family became good friends and they used to socialise frequently together.

Greg met his future wife Lynne possibly through one of the <a
href="https://s.natalian.org/2021-04-23/parties.jpeg">parties my parents used
to throw in Westville</a>. We attended their Wedding in Underburg, a very
special occasion.

Greg and Lynne were bird watchers and they were soul mates.

Greg never drove or cared seemingly to learn how to drive.

Lynne tragically died of cancer in 2009. Greg would mark her death every year
and he probably turned to drink to cope. His health deteriorated and his legs
needed to be amputated due to diabetes.

When I <a
href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/3385238865/in/photostream/">last
met Turtis</a>, he was running an art gallery "Fresh Paint", supporting South
African artists. A gentle, caring and intellectual soul is how I remember Greg.

Over the years our only contact to his wit was his <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003156408144">Facebook posts
featuring good music choices and landscape photography</a>.

He retired to Smithfield, strategically between Knysna and Joeburg, to run
accommodation for weary travellers.

Sadly this is the way his death was reported

We mourned for Greg. A very dear family friend. We mourned for South Africa. A tragic place.
