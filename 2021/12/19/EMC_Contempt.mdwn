My typical bill has been ~200SGD and now it's [five times
that](https://s.natalian.org/2021-12-02/sp-shock.jpeg)! ðŸ˜²

Since I'm [subscribed to the wholesale
market](/2019/07/24/Open_Electricity_Market/), I can expect price volatility,
but the issue I have is the terrible communication from Singapore's [Energy
Market Company](https://www.emcsg.com/), charged with operating the electricity
market in Singapore.

# No accessible API to check the price

Want an API to check the half hour fluctuations of price? Expect to pay 1000+SGD for that information!!

# No clear outlook or coverage

Why is the <abbr title="Wholesale Electricity Price">WEP</abbr> is so volatile?

You won't find out from the <abbr title="Energy Market Company">EMC</abbr>. The
[national
newspaper](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/spore-electricity-spot-prices-hit-new-highs-tariffs-expected-to-rise)
will attribute it to a "global energy crisis".

# SPgroup consumer advisory

I received post, not email from SP group with a consumer advisory on how to
switch to the regulated tariff using **Switchback**. Why not communicate this
new via email or on a Web page in a far more timely fashion?

The high <abbr title="Wholesale Electricity Price">WEP</abbr> was attributed to:

1. Global energy crunch resulting in high spot natural gas prices
2. Production issues in Indonesia's gas fields disrupting supply of natural gas
3. Unplanned outages of generation plants

The advisory also noted that the <abbr title="Energy Market
Authority">EMA</abbr> is working with generation companies including
"establishing a standby fuel facility".

Personally I wonder why _Malaysia_ or _Brunei_ is not mentioned here?

Can I expect to hear news by Singpost months after the event?

# To conclude

My issue is really poor communication of prices to the public. It has taken
months and is this a half hour "real time" and competitive electricity market?

I've asked for the [price feed before in July 2019](https://github.com/datagovsg/datagovsg-datasets/issues/450), and the answer was this information belongs to a private entity.

I'm assuming that's <abbr title="Energy Market Company">EMC</abbr> who charge
1000+ SGD a month for it which effectively keeps Singapore's wholesale
consumers in the dark.
