[[!meta title="Singapore Electricity surprise"]]
[[!meta description="A price spike"]]

I've recommended [SP group whole electricity
price](https://natalian.org/2019/07/24/Open_Electricity_Market/), and I've had
the lowest bills ~200SGD pcm until July 2021. I immediately complained and I
received a response 10 days later:

> During 26 - 29 July, there was a partial curtailment of natural gas supply
> piped from Indonesia. While there was sufficient generation capacity and gas
> supply to meet electricity demand, the Wholesale Electricity Price takes into
> account various factors, which include supply of natural gas from external
> sources, capacity of the power generation companies and electricity demand.
> Hence, the spike resulted in a rise in the WEP.
