[[!meta title="Singapore Electricity surprise"]]
[[!meta description="A price spike"]]

I've recommended [SP group wholesale electricity
price](https://natalian.org/2019/07/24/Open_Electricity_Market/), and I've had
the lowest bills ~200SGD pcm until July 2021. I immediately complained and I
received a response 10 days later:

> During 26 - 29 July, there was a partial curtailment of natural gas supply

> Hence, the spike resulted in a rise in the WEP.

Despite the aforementioned spike, Singapore's <abbr title="Wholesale Energy Price">WEP</abbr> is still up!

# Conclusion

It would appear there is no sane way to track the <abbr title="Wholesale Energy
Price">WEP</abbr>, best you can do is monitor it, but you will not really know
**why prices are high** or if they will go down.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WEP is always risky. I’m on it and I was burnt too. You can try to monitor but there is nothing you can do except maybe use less electricity. If you don’t like suprises get a retailer plan.</p>&mdash; Sau Sheong (@sausheong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sausheong/status/1439451908138160133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I feel consumers are getting pushed to a retail plan. Retailers buy at <abbr
title="Wholesale Energy Price">WEP</abbr>, so I am a little puzzled how they
can absorb the cost.
