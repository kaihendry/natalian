Bought the Samsung Model MU-PC1T0T/AM for 234.43SGD from Amazon.SG 22 August
2020, it began to leak a white substance months later, that feels like wax.

Samsung **agree it's defective**, but say in Singapore they are not entitled to
support the device because it does not with an International Warranty.

I wish I paid better attention to the [Amazon reviews of the Samsung
SSD](https://www.amazon.sg/gp/product/B0874XN4D8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1#customerReviews)
as Adrian points out:

Now I distrust Samsung.
