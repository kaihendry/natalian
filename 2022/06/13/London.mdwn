> To London's credit, it's the first major city to shake off COVID

[Candy stores on Oxford street](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sweet-shops-london-council-investigation-b2098539.html) are a thing!

Every payment is contactless

Tube is worse than I remember -- so loud!!

Still takes forever to go in and out of town

Still dust / dirty / hayfever clogging up my nose

Still homeless / begging in most popular spaces

Still ricshaws spotted in Soho

Everyone looks younger to me

Biking is still popular, bikes are a lot better than the ones you typically find in Singapore

Some people on electric scooters, but not many. Doesn't seem practical somehow.

Still no (working) water fountains to be found anywhere.
