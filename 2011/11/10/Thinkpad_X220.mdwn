Upgraded to a Thinkpad X220 model 4287CTO from a X201. Kinda prompted by [Jamie
purchasing a
X220](http://blog.jamiek.it/2011/10/arch-linux-on-thinkpad-x220.html) too.

A 64bit Archlinux install on a 166GBP OCZ 120GB Nocti SSD - mSATA SATA-II - Read
280MB/s Write 260MB/s from [Ebuyer](http://www.ebuyer.com/284727-ocz-120gb-nocti-ssd-msata-sata-ii-read-280mb-s-write-260mb-s-noc-msata-120g) went well. I can't verify the [SSDs speeds](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSD_Benchmarking), but they are much faster than the Seagate 500GB Momentus XT Hybrid SSD in my [Archlinux SSD upgrade from Ubuntu](/archives/2011/01/16/Archlinux_SSD_upgrade_from_Ubuntu).

I opted for syslinux and I can boot into Windows uncommenting a chainload
stanza in `/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg` or by using the Thinkpad own BIOS boot
menu. No more bloated Grub for me, and syslinux does allow you to alter the
cmdline. Bonus.

With `MODULES=(acpi-cpufreq cpufreq_ondemand cpufreq_powersave)` and
`/etc/conf.d/cpufreq:governor="ondemand"` configured, I do drop down to 800mhz
on all 4 processors. However the fan unlike my X201 is pretty much permanently
on. Argh! **NOISE**... It is pretty hot on the side, so the X220 seems to
exhibit some cooling issues. :( I'm not sure who to turn to. I don't think
there is any point trying to turn off the noisy fan if it feels hot to the
touch! I did find a ridiculously long [forum thread on the X220 fan's
issues](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/X-Series-ThinkPad-Laptops/X220-fan-constantly-on-revving-up-and-down/td-p/425965).

UPDATE: Appending `i915.i915_enable_rc6=1` to /proc/cmdline seems to make my
X220's temperature `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp` fall almost 10C! Why
the hell isn't this enabled by default is beyond me. The authoritative resource
is tidbits buried in <http://intellinuxgraphics.org/> and
<http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Gentoo_on_a_ThinkPad_X220> also seems
like a nice X220 resource.

Another problem is the "Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6205 (rev 34)"
wireless. Arch's `wifi-select wlan0` doesn't seem to want to join an open
network. The problem seems similar to an issue documented with my X201 and
[DHCP IP lease attempt failed on
Archlinux](/2011/09/28/DHCP_IP_lease_attempt_failed_on_Archlinux/).
I've also found general complaints about the [Intel iwalgn
driver](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/15/107).  My workaround is to `sudo
iwconfig wlan0 essid praze`, `sudo iwconfig wlan0 key off` & `sudo dhcpcd
wlan0` manually to get connected!

<strike>Another issue is the card reader. `mmcblk0: timed out sending r/w cmd command,
card status 0x700`, sdhci/mmcblk0 b0rks with errors and `REGISTER DUMP (mmc0)`
all over the shop when I put in an sdcard, which works **fine** on the X201.
Found an [Arch post of the same
topic](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=125813), which says the
problem might be fixed in Linux 3.1. I'm running `Linux x220 3.1.0-4-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Nov 7 22:47:18 CET 2011 x86_64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2620M CPU @ 2.70GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux` atm. :/</strike> Works now fine in `3.1.1-1-ARCH`.

The 9 cell battery only seems to get 4.5hrs out of it. There is probably some
tweaking I can do. Doesn't help that `powertop` doesn't work because it isn't
ported to /sysfs IIUC. :( The 9 cell upgrade wasn't much money, but I think I
would have gone for the smaller battery now, knowing what I do now.

I like the new wider & clearer screen. It suits me well with the rather excellent [tiling window
manager dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/). The little webcam (HD 720p) is also an
improvement over the one embedded in the screen in the X201. I also think the
keyboard is slightly better too, with the fat ESC & Delete keys that suit a
**vim** user well.

Of course I disabled the touchpad/Trackpad in favour of the Trackpoint "nipple" in the BIOS, but
it is unnerving to accidentally depress it from time to time as I think the
case is falling apart (which it isn't).

Occasionally the Windows hard drive spins up and makes a funny noise, even
though it's not in use. Not sure what I can do about this... perhaps I should
take it out. ;) Update: I just removed it and saved some weight. Running solely off mSata.

Volume on the X220 is quite low, compared to the X201. Almost too low to watch
a movie.

I must say buying a laptop from <http://shop.lenovo.com/> (powered by Digital
River) was a little frustrating. It exhibited a myriad of problems, most of
which I've cleared my mind off, less I go mad.

* Timing out (joy at having to pick all the parts I want again ...)
* Failed to login (I think my login is for the US site which doesn't work in the UK site), ended up ordering without an account, completely daft
* Awful, god awful forms
* Conflicting information about the on-site warranty, needed to call up to clarify this

[Lenovo UK on twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/lenovo_uk) thankfully were slightly useful.

The [UPS](http://www.ups.com/) shipment progress was also pretty ridiculous. The laptop started in China on 11/03/2011, then it went to:

* Castle Donnington, United Kingdom
* Back to Shanghai, China (w.t.f!)
* Incheon, Korea, Republic of
* Almaty, Kazakhstan
* Warsaw, Poland
* Koeln, Germany
* Castle Donnington, United Kingdom (been here 5 days earlier!)
* Exeter, United Kingdom 11/08/2011
