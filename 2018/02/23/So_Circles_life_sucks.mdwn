Since my Starhub SIM-only plan penalises by 10SGD++ every Gig you go over your
quota, I thought I should investigate the options. I did ask
[@StarHubCares](https://twitter.com/starhubcares) if I could top up and they
said basically only in the next bill. This **inflexibility infuriates me**.
Next they say I should perhaps consider an add on plan like "DataJump" which
IIUC gives me "Unlimited data" for the weekend. I hate add ons. I hate the
[deliberate confusion](https://natalian.org/2016/03/11/Prepaid_mobile_plans/).

Starhub's obfuscated 6GB per month plan basically costs me 26SGD a month on a
base level. I've managed to [reverse engineer their Website, to attempt keep track
of my quota](http://starhub.dabase.com/). As you can see from my bill, I do
take advantage of their [DataTravel Asia
Pacific](https://www.starhub.com/personal/mobile/mobile-phones-plans/value-added-services/roaming/postpaid-roaming/data-plans/datatravel.html)
product. It saves the hassle of swapping out SIMs, but I am starting to think
it's not worth it. I do not know exactly how roaming works, but it does feel
like there is more latency on the line, then just picking up a local 4G SIM
card!!

# Evaluating the Singaporean mobile options

M1 on the retail front seems very lacklustre. Legend has it, that they
accidentally routed customers to Singapore's emergency services. M1 heads went
rolling and hence their [MVNO
strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator) to
spawn <https://circles.life/>!

From Singtel, the [best no contract
plan](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/966849252990373888) is a [SIM only
12 month contract for 36.05SGD /
month](http://www.singtelshop.com/sim-only-10GB/). I would have liked to try
Singtel, but there doesn't seem to be a way of trying it without a 12 month
contract. Oh well.

So let me try Circles.life.

The pricing wasn't exactly clear from the outset, nonetheless in good faith I
bought the no contract plan for 18SGD.

UX issue 1. You choose the order time and since I'm out, I wanted my helper to
receive the order. No cannot. Must print and fill in a form to delegate that
responsibility. I don't have a printer. A lot of back of forth with the
horrible Twitter DM experience.

Sorry about this, looks like we're a little tied up at the moment. Don't worry, we'll be with you shortly.

UX issue 2. It gets finally delivered, I pop the SIM card in and launch the
App. It asks me for a number. What number? There is no number on the packaging.

How come it's asking for a number? Don't Circles.life know the number they
assigned to my account FFS?

Ok, nevermind. I have internet nonetheless. Lets <http://www.speedtest.net/> !

UX issue 3. [Circles.life is slow
4G](http://www.speedtest.net/result/i/2510470300). The speeds are about the
same speed as Starhub on 3G. I complained. They asked if I was on 4G? Ask to
try another place. Basically their customer service was absolutely clueless and
couldn't begin to fix this.

UX issue 4. 100mb for 1.20SGD... WTF?!

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hendry/image/fetch/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,h_400/https://s.natalian.org/2018-02-23/boostboost.png">

Now I thought I had about a 6GB quota with my new Circles.life SIM card. How
the HELL was a running out of 6GB on like my first day of trying Circles.life
out?

UX issue 5. Your data is Pro rated, I had to wait until March 1 to receive the 4GB. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

UX issue 6. Cancel. By this time... I was completely fed up. I now want to **end this nightmare** after just 24 hours.

<blockquote>
Thanks for sharing your feedback. Upon checking, you only received your SIM last February 21. As per Terms and Conditions which you agreed to when you placed your order with us, we require our customers to stay at least the activation month plus 1 month.

In your case, we can only process your termination request on March 31. If you still wish to proceed with the termination request, please do reach out to us again at least 3 business days before month-end, March 31 so we can assist you with the process.

In the meantime, you may opt to try our services and hopefully, you'd decide to stay with us.
</blockquote>

So now I have to set a calendar event on the 29th of March in order to cancel
and escape this ordeal. What a horrible [no contract](https://pages.circles.life/no-contract-plan/) trial. Avoid Circles.life.
