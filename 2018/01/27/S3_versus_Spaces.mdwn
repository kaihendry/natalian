Currently I have about 115GB upon **s.natalian.org** hosted in a public <abbr
title="Amazon Web services simple storage service">AWS S3</abbr> bucket,
prefixed my YYYY-MM-DD.  On average ~1GB is downloaded from it everyday. It
hosts my screenshots and anything I'd like to share by URL.

I don't allow file listings, so you need to know the full URL to object in
order to view it.

There is a lifecycle rule for the entire bucket to become Standard <abbr title="Infrequent access">IA</abbr>, which is
[priced at](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/) $0.02 per GB per month. This
works out to be 2.3USD a month.

To complicate matters, I have AWS's Cloudfront <abbr title="Content Delivery
Network">CDN</abbr> in front of my bucket which often costs 5x more that the S3
storage costs. I prefer it since it allows me to distribute from the
<https://s.natalian.org> SSL vanity URL and ensure a [fast experience for my
worldwide audience](https://youtu.be/UtW26z0aTtY).

# Enter Digital Ocean's spaces

So currently I'm trailing Digital Ocean's S3 compatible 5USD dollar a month
[Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) which includes 250GB
and 1TB of outbound transfer. So it's already looking like 2x the 2.3USD I pay
for AWS S3. Essentially the cost of storing data seems exactly the same as
Standard-IA at **$0.02 per GB**, however <abbr title="Digital Ocean">DO</abbr>
price in **tiers**. So you effectively pay up front unlike AWS's "pay as you go".

Nonetheless I am going to give it a go, since I feel like it will be the
[_second_ fastest redundant S3 option I'll have in
Singapore](https://blog.digitalocean.com/spaces-available-in-sgp1).

Please click on my [Digital ocean referral
code](https://m.do.co/c/37b3b1850b32) if you are keen to give it a try too.

I'll add information about how I will attempt to sync them up. So far I don't
have a good idea other than keeping a local copy on my NUC and S3 syncing
between them!

# rclone

I wrote to Digital Ocean support, asking how best to migrate from AWS S3 to DO
Spaces and they recommended:
<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-migrate-from-amazon-s3-to-digitalocean-spaces-with-rclone>.

However it doesn't work.

rclone v1.39
- os/arch: linux/amd64
- go version: go1.9.2

Using the `acl = private` workaround, it would appear I am copying via my local machine and sadly not direct! :(
