Currently I have about 115GB upon **s.natalian.org** hosted in a public AWS S3
bucket, prefixed my YYYY-MM-DD.  On average ~1GB is downloaded from it
everyday. It hosts my screenshots and anything I'd like to share by URL.

I don't allow file listings, so you need to know the full URL to object in
order to view it.

There is a lifecycle rule for the entire bucket to become Standard <abbr title="Infrequent access">IA</abbr>, which is
[priced at](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/) $0.02 per GB per month. This
works out to be 2.3USD a month.

To complicate matters, I have Cloudfront in front of my bucket which often
costs 5x more that the S3 storage costs. I prefer it since it allows me to
distribute from the <https://s.natalian.org> SSL vanity URL and ensure a [fast
experience for my worldwide audience](https://youtu.be/UtW26z0aTtY).

# Enter Digital Ocean's spaces

So currently I'm trailing Digital Ocean's 5USD dollar a month Spaces which
includes 250GB and 1TB of outbound transfer. So it's already looking like 2x
the 2.3USD I pay for AWS S3. Essentially the cost of storing data seems exactly
the same as Standard-IA at **$0.02 per GB**, however <abbr title="Digital
Ocean">DO</abbr> price in tiers. So you effectively pay up front unlike AWS's
pay as you go.

Nonetheless I am going to give it a go, since I feel like it will be the
[_second_ fastest redundant S3 option I'll have in
Singapore](https://blog.digitalocean.com/spaces-available-in-sgp1).

Please click on my [digital ocean referral code](https://m.do.co/c/37b3b1850b32) if you are keen to give it a try too.

I'll add information about how I will attempt to sync them up.
