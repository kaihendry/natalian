So I'm one of those tame chumps who always has a pair of khaki shorts and
pants to hand.

I'm not loyal to Dockers or Levi Strauss for that matter, but the choice for
sub-100SGD options that don't suck are slim. I quite enjoyed a Uniqlo pair, but
when I last looked in, they don't have this **basic** in stock (might they in
stock in Spring?). [Ralph Lauren](https://www.ralphlauren.asia/en/) I find are
way too expensive, especially since I generally screw up my pants since I cycle
in them and what not. Their fabrics and finishings are a little too fine.

So I've noticed [Docker do have a Website in Singapore](http://www.dockers.com.sg/SG/en_GB/) but it seems mostly broken.
Also [Lazada host a Dockers store](https://www.lazada.sg/dockers/) which should be more reliable.

# Shorts

59SGD which at the time of writing is about 45USD

[Same price on Lazada](https://www.lazada.sg/dockers-the-perfect-short-classic-fit-sand-dune-94561473.html), however the colour looks a bit brighter. Couldn't find the exact colour after searching for "shorts dockers classic fit".

What frustrates me is Lazada's identifiers
* SKU DO210FAABKAS3LSGAMZ-124972205
* MODEL 35412

Does not correspond to the 345120662 or 9602653375662 barcode, or any of the labels inside the shorts. What gives?!

Has anyone managed to decipher Docker's code?

# Trousers or pants

I'm not a fan of slim fits. Straight fit seems the most sensible. The roomier "Classic" has pleats which puts 10 years on me.

"THIS PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE." on [Docker official
Website](http://www.dockers.com.sg/SG/en_GB/category/men/pants/fit/straight/)
... whoa no Dockers at Dockers!

On Lazada they are listed as 39SGD! A 65% saving on the _in store price_ of 109SGD. Unfortunately despite having two listings:
* <https://www.lazada.sg/dockers-signature-khaki-straight-pants-british-khaki-26604722.html> only 30", 31" or 32" waist
* <https://www.lazada.sg/dockers-signature-khaki-straight-pants-british-khaki-31463574.html> only 29" waist

Bugger! I need 36"!

I found the [style
476990008](http://www.dockers.com.sg/US/en_US/men/p/476990008) on the US store
for 43USD, which is about 60SGD. Whoa, this is almost half the price of what it
is in Singapore!

# Cotton mix

So they're adding [Spandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandex) to trousers
now. I'm interested but I think since it clings too my chunky legs and I'm
often a sweaty mess in Singapore, I reckon I should give them a miss.

And they are more expensive. I do like the zipped pocket though. That's super useful when riding.

I found them on [Lazada](https://www.lazada.sg/dnkrdockers-mens-straight-fit-workday-khaki-smart-360-flex-pants-d2-new-british-khakistretch-36w-x-32l-intl-80204732.html) with a search for [workday dockers](https://www.lazada.sg/shop-men-chinos/?q=workday+dockers&from=input). However the store [is not Dockers](https://www.lazada.sg/dnkr-shop/?spm=a2o42.prod.0.0.2789915DYbdp1) and they have no stock.

Sigh. Online shopping fail.

After Googling around I did succeed in finding the Style number:
[362720001](http://www.dockers.com/US/en_US/dockers/p/362720001). Now I pray
they keep these styles consistent. Unfortunately I don't think it's in their
best interests to do that.
