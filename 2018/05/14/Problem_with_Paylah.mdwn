**tl;dr version** is that we are much better off with a crypto currency, since this implementation is a joke.

# Paper receipts are still better

When you pay for something with Paylah, the only transaction details you see are:

1. (truncated) name of the merchant
2. the date
3. amount

There is several problems with this.

* there is **no details** of what you actually bought
* there is no API to actually use your digital data

So as you can imagine, I still have to hold onto paper receipts to actually
figure out how my money was spent. This is 2018. This is the Singapore
#smartnation and this is absolutely dire.

# The balance is seperate to your bank account

I've complained to <abbr title="Monetary Authority of Singapore">MAS</abbr>
about my money being tied up in "wallets". **Paylah!** isn't the only one to
hold onto my money in a different account.

<blockquote>
I have come to notice there are more and more companies offering a "virtual wallet" where you can topup credit.

* Singtel
* Grab
* Ezlink

Ezlink has been around for a while, so I've come to accept its quirks.

My complaint is now with other companies are doing the same thing, I assume with your blessing, so more and more of my money is tied up in these individual wallets.

And my biggest complaint is that it is difficult if not impossible to withdraw my money back to SGD from these wallets.

As a consumer if I put SGD credit into a system, I expect to be able to withdraw just as easily.

Who is making this difficult? Why is it difficult? What can be done?

[MAS](http://www.mas.gov.sg/) replied asked me to first make an individual
complaint to each comapany, before coming to them. I then said, surely you're
playing "pass the buck" and MAS concluded with:

<blockquote>
MAS does not approve or prescribe specific measures or procedures to holders
for the provision of their services and holders are able to implement their own
refund procedures.  Commercial entities offering stored value facilities are
therefore best placed to address your concerns on their internal procedures and
services.
</blockquote>

Funny how there is Auto-debit offered by DBS, but no Auto-withdraw. I find this
insulting.

# It gets worse

When not in physical contact, transactions are based on telephone numbers. This
is crazy.

If the receipient you are transferring isn't enrolled in Paylah!, they simply
won't get the money and you will get refunded after a week.

Non-DBS banks have confusing / incompatible solutions, like [OCBC
Paynow](https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/online-banking/paynow.html)
causing untold confusion.
