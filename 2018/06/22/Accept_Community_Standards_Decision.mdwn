1. Recieve a message that my post from two years ago violates community standards

This is simply a link to a [Spotify song I am playing](https://open.spotify.com/track/3AsAuGTaDQzavZZThyYlop), Sexual, a song by NEIKED, Dyo on Spotify

The [suggestive artwork can be found on the Wikipedia page about the song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_(song)).

2. Complain in my timeline about the comical nature of it with a screen shot (meta)

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2018-06-22/community-meta.png" alt="Facebook post that violated community standards">

So they must do some analysis on the graphic / artwork for this to be flagged again?!

Since it was Facebook I was unable to find the permalink to my original post.

3. That meta post was also flagged as violating community standard

4. I appealed that decision on the meta post, and I lost.

5. I have sent feedback saying this is rediculous.

6. Case closed.
