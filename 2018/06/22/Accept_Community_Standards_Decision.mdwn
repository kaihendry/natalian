1. Receive a message that my post from two years ago violates community standards

The original post is simply a link, shared from Spotify to a [song I am playing](https://open.spotify.com/track/3AsAuGTaDQzavZZThyYlop); **Sexual, a song by NEIKED, Dyo on Spotify**

The [suggestive artwork can be found on the Wikipedia page about the song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_(song)).

2. Complain in my timeline about the comical nature of it with a screen shot, aka _meta post_

So they must do some analysis on the graphic / artwork for this to be flagged again?!

Since it was Facebook I was unable to find the permalink to my original post.

3. That _meta post_ was also flagged as violating community standard

4. I appealed that decision on the _meta post_, and I lost.

5. I have sent feedback saying this is ridiculous.

6. Case closed.

This Facebook experience is stuff of Orwellian nightmares. On a positive note,
they actually told me they are censoring / removing my post from view. My
expectation for other services, is that non-PC posts "disappear".

You can listen to the song on Youtube:
