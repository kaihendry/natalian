As a SME business owner, I am absolutely dismayed how awful online banking is. How do companies cope?

It's almost a **100 step process to see my balance online** with <abbr
title="The Development Bank of Singapore">DBS</abbr>! There is no API access,
except for one that [Xero](https://www.xero.com/sg/) wrangled and sometimes
their bank feeds are missing transactions due to "pending transactions". So you
get these wonderful scenarios where your bank balances do not tally up.

UPDATE: I'm told
[Bank2Xero::DBS](https://www.futureflow.io/shop/bank2xero-dbs/) may help in
these cases. Or not. Btw Xero is sadly incapable of detecting duplicates
between an imported and bank feed. :facepalm:

# Ideal OTP

Try to login using their "uniquely broken" OTP (why don't they use a
standard like Google Authenticator FFS!?!) app and you will probably hit:

The workaround is to re-launch the app on IOS. I did complain to DBS earlier this year, and I received a reply:

The [app has not been updated for two months](https://s.natalian.org/2018-03-08/mo.png). So I am puzzled when they "deployed a temporary solution" ?

I still have the same problem. I also made a video titled [Payments made
Simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXa7WxsxRP0) about DBS's insane UX.

DBS (a week later of course) then replied again to say:

(I asked how am I supposed to do this?!)

I think the "Fintech" company behind this crazy false negative is
<https://www.v-key.com/about#about-v-key>. Somebody needs to sit down with DBS
and explain to them Apple's IOS sandboxed security model that makes Apps
already insulated from malware.
