The last year I have been responsible for the "Devops" side of things with
[Unee-T](https://unee-t.com/) (a bug tracker for property issues) which
deserves mention because:

* All the source is opensource <https://github.com/unee-t/>
* It has been <https://www.remoteonly.org/>, i.e. I have been <abbr title="Working from home">WFH</abbr> in Singapore

It many ways, it has been a dream job. My colleagues are nice. Work is flexible.
I work with the technologies I enjoy. I work in the open about what I do, I've
published several aspects of my work on my [Youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/kaihendry?sub_confirmation=1) and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaihendry).

We have a F2F meeting about once a week, depending whether people are in town
or not.

# Working from home is tiresome

So my little office at home is actually my son's room, but I have made it
pretty ideal.

Quality Steel Case leap chair, quiet conditions. Quality microphone for
screencasts and a home studio for video recordings. [10G wired internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRmcktDqXlo)

I get out once a day for lunch, though I wish it was longer.

# The problem with Co-working spaces

I used to work from <https://hackerspace.sg/> but I feel the space declined in
quality. Now there is a plethora of co-working spaces to choose from around
town, notably [WeWork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeWork), but I don't like
the working environment.

Mainly because co-working environments are far too noisy and distracting!

Establishing an enclosed desk with all my (video) equipment would be... quite
expensive to say the least. I severely doubt I could sound proof it.

Tbh I seek human interaction, but the people at co-working spaces I find are
very rarely technical or people I can learn from, in the areas I am keen to learn in.

# So what and where would be better?

I fantasize about sailing around the world or doing the [Annapurna
Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Circuit), enjoying the world
beauty and nature for a portion of the day. Getting a wholesome dose of fresh air.
And then working maybe 4 hours solidly on something.

Of course this doesn't really make sense.

What about my family? I cannot expect them to come along with me. And I would
seriously miss them in less than a day. My family is in Singapore.

In "Devops" I am effectively "on call" and I face the threat of being
interrupted at any time.
I need very good and reliable Internet access and a desk/chair to basically do my work and
communicate with people. Infrastructure in Singapore is hard to beat.

# tl;dr conclusion

What I have going in Singapore, is actually pretty good.
