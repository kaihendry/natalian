* Schools are super competitive and private schools are very expensive
* There could be more children's activities

# Extra hurdles if you're an expatriate

* No citizenship if you're born in the country
* If you are offered citizenship, you need to reject your existing citizenships & ancestry
* A male <abbr title="Permanent Resident">PR</abbr> child must serve in the army for two years
* No baby bonus
* Paid maternity leave by employer is only 2 months. Singaporeans get extra 2 months paid by SG Gov
