[[!meta description="Is it worth spending 4600GBP to expedite an inevitable rural fiber internet install?"]]

For six years since my [last post on the state of my parents Superfast Cornwall
Internet connection](/2013/09/28/Superfast_Cornwall/), we have been enduring
roughly ~1Mb/s of upload, delivered via a [mile of thin copper from a cabinet equipped with Fibre (FTTC)](/2014/07/02/FTTC_is_worse_than_ADSL_when_2km_far_away_from_exchange/).

I've been monitoring this via <https://speed.prazefarm.co.uk/>, but in the last
couple of months, the upload channel has sunk to 0.75Mb/s. A lowpoint.

Now when I Apple Facetime my parents not only am unable to clearly see them, but now **audio drops** out.

Annoyingly they see and hear me clearly since their **download is still above
10Mb/s**, but I cannot. I have been very frustrated by this situation.

I wrote to my [conservative MP Scott
Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Mann_(politician)) in January 2018
commenting on the lack of any progress regarding cheaper overhead FTTH/FTTP installs and he referred
me to Julian Cowans of the Cornwall Development Company.

When the Internet started dropping four months ago, I enquired again about
<abbr title="Fibre to the Home">FTTH</abbr> options.

<blockquote>
Fibre on Demand is a FTTP (Fibre to the Premises) service available to premises connected to a fibre cabinet.
It is usually expensive to install and requires a 3 year top end contract, but the details will be dependent on the ISP.

Not many ISPs offer FoD there is an FAQ at https://www.superfastcornwall.org/your-questions-answered/ which lists the ISPs we think offer it.

You could try and get a quote from them .... and perhaps investigate using a GBVS voucher to cover the costs. These Gov funded vouchers have just been upgraded to up to £3500 per business in rural areas. There is some info about the GBVS scheme at https://www.superfastcornwall.org/getting-connected/alternative-solutions/

GBVS could also pay towards a Community Fibre Partnership solution directly from Openreach. This could be a better way forward because there are 2 registered addresses at your location (Praze Farm and Barn Conversion).
</blockquote>

I asked my <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr> [Andrews and
Arnold](https://www.aa.net.uk/) to please chase this up, and they say the
product is too expensive and complex for them to handle.

It would appear I need to do this myself, so I registered and filled in all the
details upon the [Openreach Community Leads
Portal](https://s.natalian.org/2019-06-17/CommunityLeadsPortal.mp4).

After waiting a month, a [quote came through for about
13kGBP](https://s.natalian.org/2019-10-19/cardinham-community-quote.pdf). My
heart sank, this is an amount I can't afford.

In the email where the quote was attached, was a glimmer of hope:

<blockquote>
There may be opportunities to further reduce the cost via self-dig however this will need to be discussed with the Customer Account Manager. See the bottom of the letter for contact details. If self-dig is an option, we will need maps and details of the land owners.

Not all projects are eligible for self-dig as it depends on many factors such as land type and area.
</blockquote>

Of course I enquired about that option since our neighbour actually has a digger and routinely helps us out at <https://www.prazefarm.co.uk/>

Another option to reduce the 13kGBP fibre install cost so I could Facetime my
parents were **Rural Gigabit Connectivity Vouchers**, aka <abbr title="Gigabit
Broadband Voucher Scheme">GBVS</abbr>. Alledgedly there was a [new Rural
Gigabit Connectivity
scheme](https://s.natalian.org/2019-10-19/new-rural-gigabit.pdf) to help here.

I was confused by the suppliers, the status of the EU funding, the stipulation
that a SME and the seventeen step process.

WRT supplier options given by putting the post code PL30 4HZ into
<https://gigabitvoucher.culture.gov.uk/for-residents/suppliers/>, I came into
contact with Rob Taylor of <https://www.amvia.co.uk/> who kindly explained he
could help guide me through the aforementioned bureaucracy, but the work would
eventually be done by **BT Openreach**.

At this point, I thought I should just try avoid the middle man (Rob, I'm sorry) and focus on
getting a quote with **BT Openreach**.

# BT Openreach quote

After waiting 3 months for a self-dig quote, Matt Holmes replied saying:

<blockquote>
We had been looking into self dig options for you but I'm afraid it doesn't look like there are any opportunity's. I have therefore requested a final offer for you.</blockquote>

Two weeks later the [final quote came
in](https://s.natalian.org/2019-10-19/final-quote.pdf) [for the same amount
12556GBP](https://s.natalian.org/2019-10-19/cardinham-community-quote.pdf).
Very disheartening.

However with [new vouchers](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2019/05/200m-uk-rural-gigabit-broadband-connectivity-programme-starts.html) it could be as low as **4600GBP**:

<blockquote>1 of the address is business and the other residential this means DCMS will give you £5000.00 Superfast Cornwall £3400.00 total £8400.00 leaving a balance of £4600.00</blockquote>.

# Current status

I am still mulling whether it is worth spending **4600GBP** for a fibre
install. Annoyingly once paying for this, I will undoubtedly need to pay rent
on it too.

# Other options

* A neighbor across the valley got a **free of cost** upgrade courtesy of BT. Bit of a lottery.
* Can we believe the politicians 2025 pledge? ... [oh no it has been dodged](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50042720) and wait another **six years**
* AAISP proposed getting a bonded line. IIUC this would double my ISP costs to about 200GBP per month.
