Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (klia2) is the subject of my rant. It's
terrible airport compared to Singapore's Changi Airport. Though the worse thing is that
things used to be so much better when we are able to [fly direct to Subang
airport from Singapore](/2016/11/20/Singapore_to_Kuala_Lumpur_options/).

# The long walk to freedom

No matter if you fly Scoot or AirAsia, expect to dropped off from the furthest
side of the terminal. If you have a baby, without a pram that you left as
boarded the plane in Singapore.

Now walk a kilometer, thankfully with the up and down
[walkaltors](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/07/02/more-walkalators-installed-at-klia2/)
to the first and probably only toilet.

Now after relieving yourselves, now prepare to stomach Malaysian immigration.
Don't worry! Even if you wait an hour here with your two tired kids, rest
assured it won't be as bad as crossing at Tuas or Woodlands, breathing in
vehicle Carbon Monoxide whilst being exposed to the elements.

Next "duty free", aka the sick disturbing pictures of throat cancer victims
stuck on the side of cigarette cartons. And alcohol offers that oddly appear
worse value that going to any shop.

Now prepare to walk to pick up your pram. Oh you must be tired carrying that
baby. You haven't sat for an hour have you?

Now you have your stroller! Hallelujah! Now, have you ever been so exhausted
that you left through customs without picking up your check in luggage? I have!
Next, your mission is to find the belt with your luggage waiting for you.  Next
walk to the opposite side of the terminal to find your bag.

Next! Clear customs. You now have to pick it up, and place it onto a belt to be
scanned. Will somehow help you do that? Fat chance! WELCOME TO MALAYSIA!

You're out, you're out! Order a taxi via Grab you're thinking. Door 5 it
suggests? Where is door 5 you wonder. Prepare to walk hopefully straight
seemingly for another kilometer.  Yes, it is door 5. Now with any luck, you've
booked a taxi. But the taxi driver is bizarrely asking you how much luggage you
have and where you are going. You oblige, and then he cancels on you!

What's going on? Your nuclear family is probably too big to fit in the average
Grab taxi. Try order a larger one! Wait .. wait. Thankfully there is a Family
Mart to stock up essential supplies. Ignore the touts. Wait, wait. You finally
identify your ride in the hub bub and jam of KLIA2 arrivals.

Safe... now the 1.5 hr evening jam to Petaling Jaya.
