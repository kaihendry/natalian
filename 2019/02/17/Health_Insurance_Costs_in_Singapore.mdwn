Prompted by a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ehn/status/1096258262192648192) I
thought I should document clearly how much my nuclear family in Singapore pay.

Note that these [private hospital
plans](https://www.moh.gov.sg/medishield-life/about-integrated-shield-plans/comparison-of-integrated-shield-plans),
I think are for **permanent residents** only. There are cheaper government
options, but they (allegedly) lack convenience.

1.  AIA HealthShield Gold Max A
2. Aviva MyShield Plan 1
3. AXA Shield Plan A
4. Great Eastern Supreme Health P Plus
5. Income Enhanced IncomeShield Preferred
6. Income IncomeShield Plan P*
7. Prudential PruShield A Premier
8. Raffles Shield Private

Note these [costs go up every year, as much as 68%!](/2019/01/04/Rising_private_Insurance_costs_in_Singapore/)

The aforementioned plans are also increasingly difficult to compare, despite
the Singapore government defining a _MediShield_ moniker some years ago.

The level of care we are insured for, is basically for emergencies, where
hospital treatment is required. When visiting the doctor GP, this fee (usually
~20SGD) is paid out of pocket, same goes for Dentist or Optician. Insurance
doesn't help with costs of drugs etc.

I refuse to furnish ongoing health information (my steps or
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/) activity) with Insurer's apps for discounts.
I think it's far too much of a slippery slope and privacy concern.

# AIA HealthShield

I am on a "AIA HSG MAX A" policy which costs me about 22.5SGD a month, but with
a 52SGD **rider**, which means I do **not need to pay for any deductables / top up /
excess fees** when I go for treatment. We pay annually with the bulk coming from
our governemnt mandated savings: <abbr title="Central Provident Fund">CPF</abbr>.

My 6 month old baby girl costs about 68SGD a month. My 3 year son is on "AIA HealthShield Gold Max" 25SGD policy, with a 43SGD rider PLUS a Star protector for extras which amounts for 27SGD. So about 95SGD a month.

My wife was quoted about 94SGD to get the same cover as me, which costs more
than me because of the way insurance works. She is currently insured via her
workplace, and we have no visibility to that cost.

# Summary

So our <abbr title="Permanent Residents">PR</abbr> nuclear family's monthly
health insurance costs amount to about 333SGD a month. **About 10% of our rent.**

We are super healthy and yet to use any of the services. Unlike say South
Africa there is no "medicard" system (i.e. no cash / upfront payment required),
and <abbr title="As far as I can tell">AFAICT</abbr> the process to claim is
very bureaucratic. You basically have to pay out of pocket until a claim can be
made (hence the _rider_ fee feels a bit pointless).  Furthermore most private hospitals
require a "Letter of Guarantee" (LOG), though that process is alleged to be
simpler, but you need to go an office before getting any treatment. Assuming
the private hospital has that office open etc. etc.

My hope is that this blog will help highlight options to me for better and more
importantly convenient medical care in Singapore, whilst I live and work here.
Retiring in Singapore is another kettle of fish which I won't get into now, but
do look at the [chart I made
earlier](https://s.natalian.org/2019-01-05/AIA-2019.svg), which should make you wary.
