# Singapore

<ul>
  <li class="yes">✔ Weather</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Low taxes</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Fast internet</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Investor/Immigration friendly</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Drinking water</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Reliable electricity</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Safe</li>
</ul>

There are many other reasons like political stability, infrastructure, quality
medical care, food, multicultural et al, but I thought I'd compare with those
just those arguably more [basic needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) above.

# Australia

<ul>
  <li class="yes">✔ Weather</li>
  <li>✘ Low taxes</li>
  <li>✘ Fast internet</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Investor/Immigration friendly</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Drinking water</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Reliable electricity</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Safe</li>
</ul>

It doesn't feel _that_ safe at night, though the police are rather good.

# South Africa

<ul>
  <li class="yes">✔ Weather</li>
  <li>✘ Low taxes</li>
  <li>✘ Fast internet</li>
  <li>✘ Investor/Immigration friendly</li>
  <li>✘ Drinking water</li>
  <li>✘ Reliable electricity</li>
  <li>✘ Safe</li>
</ul>

You can drink South African tap water, but it can be severely limited. Taxes
might be considered low, but if you're an earner and you don't even live in
South Africa, they are looking to steal money from you.

# European Union

<ul>
  <li>✘ Weather (weather in the South is admittedly rather nice)</li>
  <li>✘ Low taxes</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Fast internet</li>
  <li>✘ Investor/Immigration friendly</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Drinking water</li>
  <li class="yes">✔ Reliable electricity</li>
  <li>✘ Safe</li>
</ul>

Fast internet only in cities. Politically it feels surprisingly unstable. It's
not very easy to invest in Europe thanks to its bureaucracy and protectionism.
In many places, they don't seem that keen on immigration, but to its credit
free movement of people within the EU is great.
