There are many other reasons like political stability, English language,
infrastructure, quality medical care, affordable help, food, multicultural et
al, but I thought I'd compare with just those arguably more [basic
needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) above.

I've heard that it's not that immigration friendly anymore. And the cost of
living is even higher than Singapore. People complain about Singapore weather,
but I actually quite like it. I do agree it's a total pain midday to do
anything, though I usually work midday on something in the air conditioning and
do some activity either in the early morning, or afternoon.

Cold grey Winters suck.

It doesn't feel _that_ safe at night, though the police are rather good.

You can drink South African tap water, but it can be severely limited. Taxes
might be considered low, but if you're an earner and you don't even live in
South Africa, they are looking to steal money from you.

# European Union

Fast internet only in cities, in some places. Politically it feels surprisingly
unstable. It's not very easy to invest in Europe thanks to its bureaucracy and
protectionism.  In many places, they don't seem that keen on immigration, but
to its credit free movement of people within the EU is great. Most people
outside cities are pretty closed minded.

# Conclusion

Singapore has its problems, don't get me wrong. Dengue fever. Freedom of speech
is touted, though I think of [free speech as
money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeeq0qaEaLw) and with high taxation and
bureaucratic limits elsewhere, I honestly wonder if my European cousins are
really "free".

Singapore also has a high suicide rate amongst the elderly who struggle to fit
into its fast paced culture. Nonetheless I don't plan to retire in Singapore.

Singapore feels definitely seems the right place for me and my family, right
now. Though I do miss the outdoors and friends & family that Europe has to
offer.
