## Exhibit A - A modal confiming the button I just pressed

## Exhibit B - please allow popups

Authentication didn't work. It's OK. I can wait to try again. And again.

## Exhibit C - please enter your account number ... without dashes

This makes Paynow look like genius. Can't quite believe I've authenticated with my bank to provide these details again.

## Exhibit D - my reward for paying

I don't think it worked. I don't know. I received no confirmation.

If you have a DBS "multiplier account" like I do. Choose **DBS Autosave** otherwise _d2pay_ will fail.

To try pay again you need the **Document Ref No** to Search Transactions under
Payments & Transactions. I called IRAS 1800 460 4923 for 13 minutes to retrieve
this.

UPDATE TO FIND ESTAMPING DOCUMENT REFERENCE NUMBER:

1. Login using the same SingPass
2. Go to Records -> Search Stamping Records
3. Go to Document Status -> Submitted
4. Enter Submission Date -> click the calendar icon and choose 2 dates to filter your stamping date
5. Click Search
6. Then click Details, then if payment made, you may download stamp certificate. If payment does not gone through, they will ask you to make payment.
