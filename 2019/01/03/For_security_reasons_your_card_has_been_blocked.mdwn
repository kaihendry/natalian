I received a random SMS saying my card is blocked. It's not my personal card.
Let me find my business card... oh! It does end in 4938.

Strange. I am not using it, so it must be a card not present transaction. I
logged in to DBS Ideal (business banking Website). Couldn't see anything
suspicious, like my card being blocked. I guess I have no choice but to call
this number +65 63396963 or risk my AWS account not working or something crazy.

I call the number and I am promptly talking to a "customer service representative".

She asks my full name, my IC and begins to explain my card has been blocked due
to suspicious payments to **Amazon Web Services**. WHAT? YOU MUST BE JOKING?!

That's a transaction that happens EVERY MONTH for years. Why WHY WHY would it
be flagged now as fraudulent?

Sorry sir, she explains: I will make a note of this incident on your account.
To proceed to unblock the card, she then asks for the amount of a recent
transaction (I gave her DIGITALOCEAN.COM's) and how many cards I have to
unblock the card. I answered to much dismay.

WHAT THE HELL? How does this protect me DBS business banking? The whole
SMS/call process is flawed. The Website should be providing much more
information about incidents like this.

I asked for a record on my complaint over email, and she said she's not allowed
to email. DBS TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for crying wolf!
