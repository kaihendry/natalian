Last year I complained [about a 13% price increase](/2018/01/22/AIA_messaging/)
to my health insurance premium.

To my astonishment, this year it rose from 43.40SGD to [73SGD for my AIA Max
Essential A plan](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/1078473870607233025). Er, that's a **68.2%** increase !?!

My "AIA Essential A plan" IIUC (AIA seems to make this very confusing) is sold
together with the **HealthShield** (AIA HealthShield Gold Max A). The
**SHIELD** (as I understand it) is a _Singapore government initiative_ to
standardise (and supposingly simplify) [private health care insurance
offerings](https://www.moh.gov.sg/medishield-life/about-integrated-shield-plans/comparison-of-integrated-shield-plans).
I recall the **Shield plans** came into affect roughly two years ago.

This is really disappointing considering how AIA seemed to react apologetically
last year with <https://www.aia.com.sg/en/IP-Riders.html> together with a
[Strait's Times article titled "Keeping insurance premiums
affordable"](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/keeping-insurance-premiums-affordable). That year they attributed the rise to following Health Care Interpretations Task Force (HITF) recommendations, wherever they are published.

This year, in the regular mass mailing where they just gave me a [table with no
context](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/1078473870607233025), I only
noticed the hike due to my [previous blog](/2018/01/22/AIA_messaging/)! I
contacted my insurance agent who said "All the insurers increased their premium
(because) the claims are (way) too high. Every insurer lost money for this
policy". This statement seems to be confirmed by <https://www.tnp.sg/news/business/insurers-suffer-losses-intergrated-shield-plans-premiums-may-rise>.

I am wondering are the hikes down due to creation of the [Integrated **Shield**
Plan](https://www.aia.com.sg/content/dam/sg/en/docs/ip-riders/aia-maxessentialrider-infographics-march2018.pdf)
by the Government? I.e. the government foisted some change with good
intentions, the insurance industry complied and then reacted by raising the premiums
silently over the years?

Else how can health care costs go up by SO MUCH?!

I saw [the businesstimes](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/aia-singapore-sees-42-jump-in-annualised-new-premiums-for-h1) reporting on the rise, but no real reasons why and I am wondering who is looking out for the middle class who buy these policies.
