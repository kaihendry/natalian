After reading a [backup failure
story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18949484) I thought it was
time to document my digital footprint.

# When I die

When I die, I guess the most important thing is that family photographs can be
easily passed on to my wife and kids.

Until about 2010 these are all upon Flickr, with my pal Jamie maintaining a
copy.

Since then, pretty much all my photographs (and family videos) are stored with
iPhoto / Apple cloud. I don't really have a local backup. I used to try
maintain one, but I just don't have the time anymore to tether my phone and try
sync down everything clumsily using iFuse. iCloud's solution is very attractive
to me, since we have a Family setup, so if I was to die, I am going to assume
that all my photos and shares would pass onto my family members. Tbh, I need to
check this assumption.

Besides photos there are little issues like my account password list which is
hard for anyone except me to use, ssh private key, bitcoin wallet.dat with a
couple of hundred bucks. Perhaps Jamie could pick up the pieces, but I doubt it
would make sense of his time to do so.

Conclusion: Going forward I should make an attempt to import my older Flickr
images into Apple's iPhoto just for sheer convenience sake. And videos too,
like my [Wedding video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/68866977).

# Stuff I would not like to lose whilst alive

My home FreeNAS which I am pretty happy with has RAID copies of all my original
media, a Flickr backup, programming/work files and so forth. The bulk of the
space is the raw 4K video shot with my GH5 for my [Youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/kaihendry) over the space of a couple of short
years.

I guess if I lost this FreeNAS, it wouldn't be such a bit deal. I could
download copies of my produced videos from Youtube, though it wouldn't be
ideal.

I don't have an offsite backup of my FreeNAS and I probably should, though my concern is:

* privacy
* if the FreeNAS data corrupted through my own error, the offsite backups would also be corrupted, right?
* finding a place that can handle about 3TB (most video) affordably

## My online presence

Not so long ago I was kindof adamant that <https://natalian.org/> like
<http://cat-v.org/> would stay online _forever_. Tbh, I have lost that ambition to
achieve that, since I realise I would just be burdening my friends and offspring
for content that doesn't really have any importance to any one except myself.

# Conclusion

So I hope this blog helps explain my thinking with regards to my **digital
legacy** and hopefully with your feedback it can be improved.

I do have most of my eggs (precious family memories) in Apple's iCloud Photos basket right
now and I should check my recourse there.
