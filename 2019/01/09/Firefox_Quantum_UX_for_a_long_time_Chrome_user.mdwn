Profile or account management should be open. I.e. I could sync with profile
with passwords somewhere on my LAN. Now since I don't trust having my passwords
in the cloud, I'm left for protecting my local profile with a "Master password".

Password saving in Chrome mostly "just works". On Firefox I am routinely
opening up my password file and copying and pasting in credentials for sites
dumb enough to log me out. <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1518493>

I also really don't like the Save password dialog, though I have [learned how
to turn the save password prompt
off](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/aeev6i/if_firefox_saves_logins_by_default_why_am_i/edoqt8k/)

Firefox feels slower. Pages can become unresponsive quicker than Chrome. I have
no idea why. Render lag and worse of all, input lag. It feels slower to draw
things. Update: Since disabling `layers.acceleration.force-enabled` things are
much better. No hardware acceleration, but more reliable now.

No way to hide the toolbar. Important whilst taking screenshots. I could hit
F11 as a workaround, but I don't like hiding the URL bar. Also, I don't like
the menu redraw, also can be seen with hitting **Alt** (often accidentally).

When you download in Chrome, there is a nice little bar that appears. In
Firefox nothing happens until you open the weird Ctrl+Shift+Y menu.

The URL bar search is not as good as chrome. Lots of search queries are
interpreted seemingly as URLs!? Furthermore search queries in autocompletion
seem prioritised over previously visited URLs.

Firefox spell checker does not seem as good as Chrome. And I must concede
Safari seems to offer the most polished autocorrect UX.

The [restart
behaviour](https://s.natalian.org/2019-01-10/1547133189_2558x1406.png), to
interrupt a user is a bit daft.

Update: Some [Redditors have left some helpful comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/ai5dyb/blog_of_chrome_switcher_summarising_the_pain/)
