# Emergency communication to the public

There is also the [SG secure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrYR0AA-6T0) App which people are supposed to install.

I am not quite sure why IOS native features like [AMBER alerts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202743) are not used in Singapore.

# Emergency communication from the public

I don't think many people are aware of how to trigger help using their
[iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT208076). In an emergency this needs
to be second nature.

What surprises me, is that a lot of people are not 100% sure what number to dial.

Is it for the police? Fire brigade? Or an Ambulance?
Is it 112? 999? [112 is the GSM standard when in doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(emergency_telephone_number)).

How does one share the location? I wonder how the [iPhone actually shares the
location with authorities](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT208076) and more
importantly.... do we have any confidence it works?

Sometimes friends need to be relied upon! Since most people are familiar with ubiquitous WhatsApp location sharing:

<blockquote cite="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49393668">
We shared a pin of our location with friends, who contacted the local Protezione Civile (the civilian protection agency), and a team set out to find us. 
</blockquote>

[What 3 words](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/03/why-bother-with-what-three-words/) are proprietary, and can you seriously be expected to install an App in an emergency to share your location?

Is it maybe a non-emergency?

I also get via Singtel \<Message from NEA\> SMSes, which I can choose to unsubscribe to.

Social media like [@SingaporePolice](https://twitter.com/SingaporePolice)
twitter account is used for advertising missing persons.

For extreme weather and flood warnings, I think one is supposed to subscribe to [@PUBsingapore](https://twitter.com/pubsingapore).

# Non-emergency from the public

What I find curious that outside Singapore, my European counterparts frown on
reporting civil issues, for fear of being called as a "nosy busybody" at best
or "snitch" at worse.

[One service](https://www.oneservice.sg/) is an app in Singapore to help direct
feedback to right government department. I wish it was just a Web form, but
instead there is a clunky App experience to look forward to.
