My opinion is that I'd prefer to have a society where people reported back to the
local civil services and the local civil services clearly communicated the
status quo back to the public instead of say **privacy killing** blanket
surveillance.

Privacy is a feature after all.

# Emergency communication to the public

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hendry/image/fetch/f_auto/e_shadow/https://s.natalian.org/2019-09-05/sgsecure.jpeg" alt="DOWNLOAD the sgsecure app">

Instead of a URL, the native [SG
secure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrYR0AA-6T0) App is what Singapore
residents need to install.

I am not quite sure why mobile features like [Cell
broadcasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_Broadcast) or [AMBER
alerts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202743) are not used in Singapore.
I've never seen one.

[Sirens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Warning_System_(Singapore)) are
used in Singapore and are referred to as the <abbr title="Public Warning
System">PWS</abbr>.

Once a siren goes off, I think the idea is the population tunes into a [radio
or TV for further
information](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/home/civil-defence-shelter/public-warning-system).
Unfortunately personally I don't own a TV or Radio.

Though judging from the latest communication, it appears Siren and then check
**SGSecure**. Still dismayed it can't be a well known .sg Web URL instead.

# Emergency communication from the public

I don't think many people are aware of how to trigger help using their
[iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT208076). In an emergency this needs
to be second nature!

What surprises me, is that a lot of people are not 100% sure what number to dial.

Is it for the police? Fire brigade? Or an Ambulance?
Is it 112? 999? [112 is the GSM standard when in doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(emergency_telephone_number)).

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hendry/image/fetch/f_auto/e_shadow/https://s.natalian.org/2019-09-05/995.jpeg" alt="Use an App to call 995">

How does one share your location? I wonder how the [iPhone actually shares the
location with authorities](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT208076) and more
importantly.... do we have any confidence it works?

Sometimes friends need to be relied upon! Since most people are familiar with
ubiquitous WhatsApp location sharing:

<blockquote cite="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49393668">
We shared a pin of our location with friends, who contacted the local Protezione Civile (the civilian protection agency), and a team set out to find us.
</blockquote>

I've noticed in the UK, a push for [What 3
words](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/03/why-bother-with-what-three-words/) are
proprietary, and can you seriously be expected to install an App in an
emergency to share your location?!

Is it maybe a non-emergency?

I also get via Singtel \<Message from NEA\> SMSes, which I can choose to unsubscribe to.

Social media like [@SingaporePolice](https://twitter.com/SingaporePolice)
twitter account is used for advertising missing persons.

For extreme weather and flood warnings, I think one is supposed to subscribe to [@PUBsingapore](https://twitter.com/pubsingapore).

# Non-emergency from the public

What I find curious that outside Singapore, my European counterparts frown on
reporting civil issues, for fear of being called as a "nosy busybody" at best
or "snitch" at worse.

[One service](https://www.oneservice.sg/) is an app in Singapore to help direct
feedback to right government department. I wish it was just a Web form, but
instead there is a [clunky App experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA9yhKxdopI) to look forward to.
