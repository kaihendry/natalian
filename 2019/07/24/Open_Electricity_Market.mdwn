On 1 March 2019 in the East area of Singapore where I live, the **Open
Electricity Market** (aka energy unbundling) launched. I've been purchasing
electricity from the sole electrical grid operator in Singapore:
[SPgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Power) (aka Singapore Power).
Now there are several other companies pitching **cheaper electricity** using
the same government-owned electricity infrastructure.

# Why doesn't SPgroup just give me cheaper electricity like these other companies?

That was my first thought and on the [3rd of
May](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/1153241451670597633) someone pointed
out I could just sign up for [Wholesale electricity
price](https://s.natalian.org/2019-07-24/market.png), which I did.

On [June the 3rd, a new meter was
installed](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/1135381804242759680) at my
home, which now reports my "real time usage" to SPgroup. As I understand it,
on this wholesale price plan, I get charged for the power I consume at a
variable supply/demand wholesale electricity price, defined every **30 minutes**.

# So how much am I being charged right now?

As I type this, I am on the wholesale plan with SPgroup. I can see at 10:30AM
that at 4AM I used 0.404 kWh via the App. Why the 6 hour delay!? ðŸ¤¦ My own
usage is not on their Website <https://services.spservices.sg>. With the App
you can view them with delay, but they are not downloadable/scrapable, aka
there is **no API** for my usage data to better understand my energy consumption!

And what was the price of that kWh at 4AM? This is the crazy part. SPgroup
can't tell me. They point to the [Energy Market
Company](https://www.emcsg.com/data), which requires a **$$$ Data
Subscription**. In response I filed a [Dataset request: Wholesale electricity
price](https://github.com/datagovsg/datagovsg-datasets/issues/450).

As a consumer I have been cross referencing my own [Energy usage metrics taken
with a current cost device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfJYFUBQgAs), but
now with this new system, I am unable to determine if my bill is correct.
Because I don't know the price I am paying for electricity now.

# Bills compared

The old bill (combined with water) was quite simple for electricity:

The new **Wholesale electricity Price bill** has many new line items, which I don't understand:

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2019-07-24/new.png" alt="My first wholesale electricity bill">

Focusing just on the kWh price, ignoring transmission charges et al, it's now
**0.0929**, down from 0.2279SGD per kWh. That's a 84% difference! Pretty drastic.

But remember that final rate **0.0929** is totally opaque. It should be a usage
weighted half hourly average of the wholesale price at those half hourly
intervals. It could be so low because I consumed most of the kW/h units over
the early hours of the morning. I simply **don't know** the pricing was at those
past intervals were AND what SPgroup registered as my usage then via my new
usage sending digital meter.

# Conclusion

The wholesale "realtime" (actually 30 minute intervals) price needs to be
properly exposed as [my request
asks](https://github.com/datagovsg/datagovsg-datasets/issues/450), as well as
my "real time" usage which only SPgroup _authoratively_ (I know too, roughly)
knows. Right now I'm basically in the dark about how much I'm paying for
energy.

Cynically I suppose we are in a "honeymoon period". I suspect the **current low
energy** prices are to incentivise consumers to switch to the myriad of other
energy companies, who currently just buy energy from SPgroup as I do.  Energy
prices will rise in my mind, no doubt.

Nonetheless I hope this new <https://www.openelectricitymarket.sg> landscape
lays down a (private, capitalistic) **competitive** foundation for new
(cleaner) sources of energy. Just wish _choice_ involved less confusion and
frustration by consumers like myself. 

If you like many Singaporean households do not go through the rigmarole of
switching, you will be penalised!
