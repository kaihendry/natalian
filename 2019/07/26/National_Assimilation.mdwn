My personal identity is something I'll continue to grapple with all my life.
Tbh **identity politics** is a big turn off for me, but there is a [culture
war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war) raging and I need to pen my
thoughts.

Being an immigrant and the son of parents from different countries, it's only
lately I've come to notice how countries or rather their nationalism
accommodates the "Global citizen".

* African American
* Singaporean
* Malaysian Chinese
* French
* English or Scottish
* British Indian
* German
* "White" South African

Some countries accommodate the double barrelled identity: "Malaysian-Chinese".
Some don't, like France or often enough _nationalists_. Most haven't seemed to
have figured it out!

Things fell into place for me whilst listening to [Carl
Benjamin](https://www.youtube.com/user/SargonofAkkad100) on
<https://renegadereport.co.za/2019/07/23/sargon-of-akkad/> podcast.

I can understand the merits of **assimilation** (for want of a better word). "To
be French" rather than [African
French](https://twitter.com/bbcafrica/status/1020192086367309824?lang=en). But
I feel it sets a dangerous almost fascist precedent. Nonetheless it delivers us
from fracturing identity politic bullshit!

I certainly don't feel 100% "South African". Nor totally "British". Or
"Singaporean" as I call home. I guess my title is Singaporean Expat <abbr
title="Permanent Resident">PR</abbr>, which is most accurate. Though at the same time,
gives me no rights or strong identity.

I wouldn't mind being a Singaporean citizen, but that would again be a **forced
assimilation**. I.e. I would have to give up any other citizenship. "European
Singaporean", maybe? It's probably not nationalistic enough for most nation
builders.
