This is an update of [Singapore home
cooking](https://natalian.org/2015/06/09/Singapore_home_cooking/). I'm now
living in the fabulous Telok Kurau area. Easy access to the city. **Quiet**.
Decent park. Great nearby amenities. Park connector down into East coast park.
Quality of life? Not sure it can be beat. Oh, did I mention I have 2Gbps <abbr
title="Fibre to the Home">FTTH</abbr>? =)

# Wine

[Chardonnay is as low as 19SGD from Redmart](https://redmart.com/search/chardonnay#price=10-25&sort=price_asc). Do let me know if there is a cheaper supplier of wine in Singapore. I'm fine with box wine. I prefer South African.

19SGD per bottle is actually cheaper than [Changi airport's Duty free incumbent DFS](https://natalian.org/2015/01/07/DFS_versus_Cold_Storage/).

# Fish

Best value for money seems to be the ~50SGD per kilo of wild caught Sockeye
salmon from <http://thealaskaguys.com/>. However cooking wild salmon is
actually a bit more difficult that farmed salmon, since it needs to be
carefully basted, else it will be dry.

The Alaskan salmon is amazingly cheaper than [Oh Deli's farmed Scottish
salmon](https://www.ohdeli.com.sg/shop-now/fresh-fish-smoked-fish.html).

However Oh Deli do pretty amazing Smoked salmon.

# Honey

I buy from the same place the RedMart buys from
<https://www.nature2000.com.sg/>.

Order [over 100SGD and get delivery
free](https://s.natalian.org/2017-09-15/honeyorder.png).

# Bread

Farmer's bread loaf from German bakery <http://www.wernersoven.com.sg/> is still the family
favourite.

# Vegetables

Most of our fresh produce still comes from Fair Price (NTUC) and Geylang Serai market. We can't really trust online or rather we have not found a rhythm with online vendors such as <https://www.opentaste.sg/>.

Tbh I am not satisfied with the quality of produce at NTUC. I was speaking to a [South African fruit importer](http://crownfruit.sg/about.html) and he was telling me NTUC would rather buy Chinese citrus than say South African which I am not pleased about!

# Cheese

The [Cheese shop on Joo Chiat](http://www.cheeseshop.sg/) is amazing. I
spend a lot of money there. They also stock [momolato
gelato](http://momolato.com/) which is unnervingly incredible.

# Meat

Service is good at Oh Deli, though Foodie Market Place is now conveniently open
at 313 Tanjong Katong Road Singapore 437096 and their Black Angus is AWESOME.

I have been meaning to order <https://hubers.com.sg/> online, but I found it
too difficult to choose. I wish I could set a budget of say 100SGD a week and
they almost give a surprise quality bundle of meat to cook. I would like to try
new cuts at this point.

# Eggs

The best eggs I've found are the [14.90SGD for a dozen organic eggs from
OhDeli](https://www.ohdeli.com.sg/catalogsearch/result/?q=eggs). Though
recently I heard [Redmart are doing similar cage free eggs for
6.70SGD](https://redmart.com/product/redmart-cage-free-australian-eggs-106488).
After trying them, there isn't any discernible taste difference to the normal
Malaysian supermarket eggs.

# Coffee

Difference between good and bad coffee for me is night and day. I buy my
**ground filter coffee** from [Papa Palheta](http://www.papapalheta.com)
despite their online service being a fiasco. It's got to the point where I just
WhatsApp an employee named John instead of dealing with their [broken online
plans](http://www.papapalheta.com/mustdrinkcoffee/plans) and the fact their
online system seems to forget about my request to grind the beans every second
order. Never mind the fact no one seems to answer their email there. Their
product is excellent, so I am reluctant to try something else.

# Wish list

[Amazon Prime Now](https://www.amazon.com.sg/primenow) are here, but I don't
like how the ordering process is App only. I need the Web and its links to
approve my purchases with my wife!

I honestly don't understand why anyone would shop at
<https://coldstorage.com.sg/> since their products and prices are simply
uncompetitive for me. I do day dream about a German competitor like Aldi or
Lidl entering the market. Yes, I actually like their products and price points
despite the haters.

Nonetheless as I mentioned about [Hubers](https://hubers.com.sg/). I wish there
was "curated online shopping & delivery" with set budgets with seasonal top
quality produce and specials.
