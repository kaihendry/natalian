You'll miss email when it's gone. Replaced with some proprietary messaging like
Facebook or Twitter.

Businesses must use email better!

* Allow for attachments or better still, use clean URLs. There have been times
  when I've communicated with customer services who are unable to open
attachments.

* Do not use auto-responders, they pollute with noise.

* Reply QUICKLY. Singapore government seem to think 2 weeks is OK for email, but 2 hours is used with Facebook. WHY?

* Ensure the text counterpart of an email exists! Or better still, just keep it
  in plain text. Don't pollute with noisy HTML and nonsense graphics and
footers.

* Teach your employees basic email etiquette. Sometimes emails are quoted and
  replied inline if they contain several points. There have been times when
I've received a reply saying my email is empty, though what I did was quote and
reply!
