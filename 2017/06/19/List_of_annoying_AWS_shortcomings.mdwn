1. Unpredictable region roll out. When will Singapore get AWS Batch for e.g.?

1. Wrapping your head around regions first... how some things like ACM only seems to work in us-east-1.

1. Autoscaling and load balancer seem poorly connected, no CloudWatch Per Autoscaling Group

1. No way to track [memory exhaustion](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/876657690780598272)

1. [Launch time != Uptime](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/876658250485248000)

	Launch = day 0
	Uptime = continuous availability since last OS restart

1. You can't seem to query CloudWatch metrics by tag

1. Amazon Linux doesn't support SystemD

1. Amazon Linux only updates on boot, so you probably need to rotate out your service

1. Cloud Formation lag, making it difficult to orchestrate stuff. By the time it
   does come available, you've long forgotten about your manual process.

1. DynamoDB throughput exceeded... this happens even on autoscaled managed instances in my experience!

1. [DynamoDB JSON](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44535445/unmarshall-dynamodb-json) Why... WHY!?

1. [IAM policies are a total PITA](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/857777338632646657). An ongoing
service to tighten IAM policies based on usage is sorely needed.

1. AMIs should be more like Docker images, i.e. infra as code, treated like
	cattle. AMI snapshots and **systems manager services** patching doesn't
seem to make sense to me.

1. Redirects in S3 can be quite unreasonably painful. Same goes for setting up
	CORS. Or cloudfront for that matter. Should be far more streamlined.

1. Debugging Lambda is such an incredible pain right now.

1. AWS Marketplace sellers only available to US incorporated business

1. AWS has a lot of services which are probably best done by third parties and they should focus on core commodified services.

1. I've had a terrible experience with AWS ECS. Could I be coaxed to give it another try?
