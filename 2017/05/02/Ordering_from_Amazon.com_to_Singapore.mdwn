1. [Choose items that can be shipped](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201117930)
2. Import & Customs
3. Currency conversion
4. [Shipping and handling](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202053180)

# Import fees

Amazon asks this up front in the form of a [Import fees
deposit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201910710&qid=1493693725&sr=1-1),
which is an estimation, when your value goes above 400SGD (including shipping).

You must [spend less than 400SGD to be granted GST relief](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/importing-goods/import-procedures/importing-by-post-or-courier-service).

# Shipping and handling

You might be eligible for free shipping if the total order is above 125USD.

# Conclusion

Use Amazon when you can afford to wait two weeks, and spend > 125USD but not
more than 400SGD (~285USD).
