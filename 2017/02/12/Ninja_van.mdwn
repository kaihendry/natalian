I am not too familiar with the Ninja Van company, but they do seem popular in
Singapore since [Singpost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Post) seem
totally uncompetitive for local deliveries.

However I wrongly assumed they would be innovative despite hiring engineering
talent.

For example in my experience they don't tell you in either email or SMS where
your packages and **when** it will be delivered.

Like many people who work, I need to arrange for someone at home to receive my
order. Hence a frustrating experience ensues where I am left in the dark when a
package will arrive.

Ideally their logistics systems would allow me to delegate the delivery to my
helper. Usually what ends up happening is a delivery man interrupts me at work
with a phone call, asking if anyone is at home, leaving me with an awkward
co-ordination problem between the delivery driver (who is usually difficult to
understand over the phone) and my helper who is usually busy running errands
herself. Things get worse for me since I save 5SGD a month by not having Caller
ID enabled on my [Starhub SIM only
plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXILNezACiU).

Sigh ...
