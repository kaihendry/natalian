[[!meta title="SSL Iki.fi via Amazon Certificate Manager"]]
[[!meta description="This is the best way to host your personal iki.fi homepage on Amazon Web Services"]]

As <https://crt.sh/?q=%25.iki.fi> testifies, <https://hendry.iki.fi> is secured
by SSL using the [AWS Certificate
Manager](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=ap-southeast-1#/).

First you need to get a mail server running upon the A/MX field and answer
emails to <webmaster@XXXX.iki.fi>. I did this quickly by getting <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_(software)">Postfix</a> running on
an VPS with `mydestination = hendry.iki.fi` and then aliasing to forward to my
email address that I read. Amazon will send a link you need to activate from
your AWS account.

Then I setup a hendry.iki.fi hosted zone on
[Route53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/), Amazon Web Service's DNS
control panel.

Once that's done, I then configure iki.fi with the AWS name servers for my hosted zone.

Notice the string **ei-mulle-dns-secondarya** to the CNAME-tietue field and it
will disable the zone transfer checks.

Special thanks to Tero Kivinen for his excellent work at <http://www.iki.fi/>,
an incredible lifetime redirection service, typically used by *.helsinki.fi
alumni.
