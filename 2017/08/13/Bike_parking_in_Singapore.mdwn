This is typical of bike stands in Singapore:

This front wheel clasp doesn't hold the front wheel and what happens is the
bike when awkwardly locked to it, leans onto it to stay somewhat upright.

Sidenote: Locking just the front wheel is insecure, a "lean to" type parking
makes it easier to lock the frame securely.

Now over time, I've found this to warp my front wheel. In a much shorter time,
if someone accidentally pushes the bike, the pressure on the front wheel will
cause it to damage.

Poorly designed bike racks like these are found in both public and [private
condominium spaces](https://s.natalian.org/2017-08-12/condo.JPG).

It's much safer to lean your bike along a wall, but that seems prohibited.

## tl;dr

Bike parking needs to be the better designed lean to sort and better maintained
in Singapore. I would seriously pay for safe parking for my bike at this point,
given the poor options.
