Mikrotik unexpectedly cost me many hours of experimenting and learning to
setup. Was it worth it over using Ubiquiti?

Probably not, though I did learn a lot more about networking in the process.

Here is the [configuration that took me a long time to create for Praze
Farm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mikrotik/comments/6rq85t/aa_hap_lite_configuration_for_home/).

# Winbox

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2017-08-20/winbox.png" alt="Winbox on Archlinux">

You can get `wine /usr/share/winbox/winbox.exe` running under Archlinux, and
you need to use this tool if your device has some issue getting an IP address.

I do prefer to use a Web interface, but if you find the Web interface doesn't
work, do quickly try Winbox, you might be surprised that it works better!

# Avoid Quickset

Mikrotik's [modes are not sufficiently well
documented](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Quickset) and I have had bad
experiences where I've applied them and it messed up my configuration in an
unexpected way.

# Firewall interface sucks

Even the cheapest routers have an easier to use Firewall interface than
Mikrotik. Would be good if that had some sane wizard at the very least to get
you up and running and your port 22 protected!

# <abbr title="Power over Ethernet ">PoE</abbr> is cool

Stringing along another access point without the need to worry about powering
it, is useful. However I do wish there was PoE camera hardware offered by
Mikrotik too.

# Roaming

My wifi at home is open and you don't need to authenticate. So I am not if
Ubiquiti's claims of [Fast
roaming](https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004662107-UniFi-Fast-Roaming)
have merit. Apple [seems to say it is all a client side
decision](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT203068) how to move between Access
Point stations.

Attractively [Mikrotik does have the ability to kick off
clients](https://blog.linitx.com/howto-improved-capsman-wireless-client-roaming/)
but I didn't have time to try it.

# Update: QoS

Thanks to Paul Hendry who contacted me over email and introduced [Queue
tree](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Queue#Queue_Tree) to me. I have
turned this A&A control graph:

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2017-08-14/blue-flame.png" alt="Saturated line">

to

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2017-12-08/under-control.png" alt="QoS line">

Crucially I always thought a modem could work out when and where it's being
saturated with the upstream (max-limit), but Paul points out:

	QoS only kicks in when a link is being saturated. The router thinks it has a
	100mb ethernet port to play with so would never queue traffic going out to your
	DSL modem.


So I know my parent's line is syncing with an upstream like so:

	2017-11-09 Down:20.8 (20.7/20.8/23.1) Up:1.4 (1.4/1.4/1.5)
	2017-09-04 Down:19.0 (18.7/18.9/19.0) Up:1.5 (1.2/1.4/1.4)
	2017-08-15 Down:19.3 (18.0/19.0/19.2) Up:1.4 (1.3/1.4/1.4)

With Paul's help I've successfully sorted out my Apple Facetime issues with:

	/queue tree
	add max-limit=1448k name=Upload parent=AAISP queue=default
	add limit-at=800k max-limit=800k name=Upload-UDP packet-mark=UDP parent=Upload
	add name=Upload-Else packet-mark=Else parent=Upload queue=default

This is explained by Paul as:

	The (above) will set a maximum upload of 1.4Mbps on your PPPoE interface and
	allow everyone to upload to the full 1.4M except when UDP wants to upload then
	UDP gets up to 800Kbps whilst everyone else gets throttled back to what's left.

## Accounting

My dream would to have a table of each named client and their usage. Currently
I'm torching and matching the IP with the DHCP client table manually. What an
utter PITA!

# Conclude

I wish Mikrotik software was more open & didn't have this license weirdness..
Hopefully that would reshape the community and its software. For example, a
consumer device with [Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time
Congestion
Control](https://www.reddit.com/r/mikrotik/comments/6t8zpi/does_mikrotik_have_any_congestion_control_like_bbr/)
would be.. nice!

Better support. Ubiquiti's support surprisingly has fast, responsive support
compared to emailing Mikrotik. Perhaps tools that were able to load a
`supout.rif` and to simulate RouterOS could help troubleshoot problems without
requiring a "consultant"?

Mikrotik, how about having a public <abbr title="Bug Tracking System">BTS</abbr>?
