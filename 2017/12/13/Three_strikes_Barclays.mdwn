UPDATE: [A video where I compare banking between Barclays & Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/_TxuT2U4TYE)

* [Strike 1](https://natalian.org/2014/06/18/Barclays_made_my_backup_account_dormant_and_took_my_money/) - made my backup account dormant
* Strike 2 is when I was [locked out my own account and money](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/883841540589625345) until I could travel to a UK branch from Singapore to verify my identity
* Strike 3 is [requiring the information on how much I earn and how much tax I pay](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/928798501059772417), i.e. a total contempt of my privacy

At first Barclays claimed it was to [detect fraudsters and
criminals](https://twitter.com/BarclaysUKHelp/status/928871372494966784). I
guess being a life long customer is not good enough?

Then Barclays claimed it is a [legal
requirement](https://twitter.com/BarclaysUKHelp/status/928872988061073408) set
by the FCA.

I contacted the [FCA](https://www.fca.org.uk/) asking about these requirements and they replied:

<blockquote>
..we don’t have any rules which specify what information a firm must ask from their customers in relation to ‘knowing your customer’.
</blockquote>

Furthermore FCA asked me to ask Barclays:

<blockquote>If Barclays can tell you exactly which rule or which regulations
specify that they must ask you how much you earn then please let me know and I
will look into this further for you.</blockquote>

And Barclays replied [they can only tell me in private
DM](https://twitter.com/BarclaysUKHelp/status/928920578597310464). I.e. they
won't tell us straight.

FCA re-iterated that:

<blockquote>
no specific rules which state that a firm must ask you how much you earn and this is usually a commercial decision on the firm themselves
</blockquote>

Therefore Barclays initial claim it was for a [legal requirement](https://twitter.com/BarclaysUKHelp/status/928872988061073408) is also poppycock.
