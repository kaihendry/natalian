[[!meta title="Foreigner Singapore 2FA"]]
[[!meta description="Singapore's 2FA rollout is pretty theatrical waste of time, especially for EP holders"]]

I'm keen on two factor authentication (2FA) to improve account security. I use
Google Authenticator and I must have ported over about 10 accounts to it.

So when Singapore government **online identity system** "Singpass" announced
they are making <abbr title="two factor authentication">2FA</abbr> mandatory, I
was fine with it.

But after looking into it and effectively being locked out my account since I
was not registered by a deadline, I have a bitter taste in my mouth about it.

There is so much confusing information online. This is what I wish I knew as
Employment Pass (EP) holder.

* Auto-registration is not actually automatic
* Auto-registration is put through by your employer
* You must be mailed a PIN
* The address will be your employers office and that can lead to confusion
* SMS is just part of the process
* Once you register you have a "NAF" which IIUC is a identity provider for Singpass, so it's kindof confusing with two accounts

To conclude my registration issues came down to my PIN not being issued to me.
I switched jobs in June and I think that may have caused the confusion over a
period of a month.

So once registering with 2FA and logging in a "OTP" is sent over SMS. My number
was correct at the beginning of the process so I am not quite sure what were
the merits of going through this error prone PIN mailer process.

I believe you can upgrade for 10 or 20 dollars to a physical token instead of
receiving an insecure SMS which obviously will never work when abroad, but I'm
really not motivated to upgrade. Especially when I know virtual 2FA via Google
Authenticator is the sane way to do it.

All & all a very poor experience with <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/30756038700>Singapore's Government Technology Agency (GovTech)</a>.
