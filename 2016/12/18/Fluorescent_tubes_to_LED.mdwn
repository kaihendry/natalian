Prompted by flicker in my videos, I have replaced a couple of [T8 Fluorescent
lamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent-lamp_formats) with LED based
ones. I am very impressed as I didn't even know such products existed!

However I couldn't find circular LED bulb tubes (like the T9) commonly found in
HDBs in Sim Lim tower.

Later I realised with some help that I needed to replace the tube with a **LED
tray** with magnets. Out came the heavy ballast and starter.

LED is an incredible technology, compared to [Fluorescent
lamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp), LED is:

* cheaper
* faster to start
* less components (no starter or ballast)
* lasts longer
* safer
* brighter
* more power efficient
