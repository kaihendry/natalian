**tl;dr**

* the transfer process in unrelated to the value of the transfer so a $500,000
  transfer would require the same convoluted process as a $0.05 transfer
* [OCBC recommend their Pay Anyone
  service](https://twitter.com/OCBCBank/status/808488319072014336), which seems
to require an App install and to be connected to the recipient by mobile number
which sounds really awful to me. They say it's good for [microtransactions on
Carousell](https://twitter.com/OCBCBank/status/808529237900689408) but even
people I know who work on Carousell have never heard of anyone using this.
Totally delusional and I wish they would fix their Web app flow.

On the ground [OCBC](https://www.ocbc.com/group/group-home.html) are quite a
good bank especially with their ATM availability.  Online it is a bit of a
nightmare.

Consider the use case of paying someone online 3.30SGD for an [item on
Carousell](https://carousell.com/p/41642060/).

Ok, first login with that token you've misplaced. I am unable to login on my
mobile. No idea why. So, on your laptop find the UI to pay someone under
Transfer funds, other Singaporean accounts and [remember POSB =
DBS](/2012/12/04/Singapore_banking_surprises/).  If you got here without losing
you mind, just you wait!

Now you need to ask the person who you are transferring to the:
* Name (as per bank record)
* Email address

For some reason, an account number is not enough with OCBC! Oh no!

Oh also, make sure you take out the dashes from the account number without
accidentally removing a digit! Computers are really good at pruning characters,
but OCBC programmers gets you to do this.

Now you need to "sign" the last 6 digits of the account number. Why? I have no
idea. I just want to pay 3.30SGD and be done with it over 10 minutes ago. I
don't want to purchase anything again from the seller hopefully so I don't want
his account polluting my OCBC payees list. But you don't have that choice.
March on!

Now you can choose the newly added payee to transfer 3.30SGD! Yahoo... oh but
pickup the token again, now you need to enter a _masked_ (seriously stupid)
<abbr title="One time password">OTP</abbr> password. It's a trivial sum FFS!
WHY WHY WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Ok, I should have just gone to Woodlands and met this guy in person to pay
cash. It would be far easier to try do something online with OCBC.
