[[!meta title="Travelling to Petaling Jaya from Singapore"]]

Since my wife is Malaysian, we travel from Singapore to [Petaling
Jaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petaling_Jaya) (PJ) quite often for family
events and such.

Over the years of living in Singapore I have noticed the time and money to
journey the **350km** seems to increase.

# Bus

Bus is the cheapest at 60SGD return and for example
[FirstCoach](http://www.firstcoach.com.my/schedule.php) is our current choice.
However as we found out when we travelled with our baby boy the long hours in
the bus for an infant is very difficult.

Journey time: between 6 and 9 hours. Holiday traffic like CNY is just a
nightmare.

The causeway crossing at Tuas is a painful experience, especially with a baby
who can't use the biometric express queues until the child is four years old.

# Flights

There are about 40 flights a day between Singapore (SIN) to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia (KUL).

Journey time: 4.5 hours in best case

Price: Varies tremendously, but typically in the 150-250SGD range for a return
fee booked weeks in advance. 3x the cost of a bus and lets not forget the taxis
to and fro the airports! (~20 SGD + 120MYR) * 2

Annoyingly KLIA airport is actually really quite far from Petaling Jaya.  Since
we travel as a group of three, the Uber at ~120MYR is still cheaper than the
KLIA Ekspres which is 55MYR x 3 people = 165MYR and of course doesn't get you
to PJ.

There is a smaller airport [Subang
Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Abdul_Aziz_Shah_Airport), but
only [Firefly operate at the
terminal](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=flights+sin+szb) and you need to
book long in advance for a reasonable price.

# Car

Crossing at Tuas or Woodlands in traffic is an absolute nightmare. Buses are
expedited, not cars. It's not a fun drive. Renting a car from Singapore to
travel to Malaysia is expensive.

# Train

Presently the train to KL takes umpteen hours (overnight usually), however there is a new
[Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High Speed
Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur%E2%80%93Singapore_High_Speed_Rail)
proposed but it won't be ready until **2026**.

Another annoying aspect is proposed new the train terminates in Jurong East,
not downtown Singapore. Since I live in East Singapore, it can easily take upto
an hour to get home from Jurong!!

Journey time (once completed in 10 years time): 99 minutes plus 1 hr from Eunos-Jurong & 1 hr between KL & PJ =~ 4 hours

# Conclusion

In my mind, the overland route with the crowded and chaotic causeway border
crossing makes it not an option for us anymore. Would be nice if
[ICA](https://www.ica.gov.sg/) published some metrics on their performance to
give us some confidence. The new proposed train line is very welcome, but if
they don't do sensible things like check passports on the train I feel
potential any time savings will be lost.

At this point of time, I am left having to carefully plan my trips to Malaysia
and booking flights in advance. All options are equally inflexible. If you need
to make a last minute change, you basically lose a lot of money.
