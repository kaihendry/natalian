My curiosity got the better of me and 4hrs into my trip I paid 21.95USD for
wifi for the entire journey from SIN to SFO.

This is the first time I've had Internet on a plane and I feel like I am living
in the future!

It surprisingly works. Though it wasn't easy to purchase the subscription.

The age old buying Internet problem which I've yet to see anyone solve well
from a wifi capture/redirect. Chrome didn't work, but Safari did once I
navigated manually to `172.19.248.1`.

Next I tried to pay with Paypal, but that didn't work because it wanted to SMS my iPhone in Airplane mode.ðŸ¤”

So next I tried my OCBC Visa card and that request timed out.

I tried again, and this time I finally made a purchase!!

Sadly I couldn't WhatsApp because <https://web.whatsapp.com/> wanted to chat to my phone whilst it was in Airplane mode. Sigh!

Good news is that I did manage to Imessage and chat to my wife:

I hope <https://www.panasonic.aero/> will make this a little smoother in the future.
