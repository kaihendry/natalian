<p>I take that back about Ubuntu in my <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2005/02/19/laid-back/">last post.</a> The machine only had 128mb of Ram. These machines, some P4 2.6Ghz all have 128mb of <span class="caps">RAM</span>. Actually WinXP seems to run Ok, but the live CDs choke. Incidentally all these WinXP seem infected with some spyware. Gatorware et al. Of all the net cafe machines I have used in my journeys, I have say at least 90% are infected. Scary. Worse thing is, they feck up my net connection. :(</p>

<p>So I tried the Ubuntu 4.10 install CD thinking maybe I could sneak a setup to one of these Bali net cafe PCs. It worked! I had a little problem with Ubuntu wanting to download updates that would have taken 5hrs. Pleasantly surprised to find a sudo system. Now I just need to work out what this <span class="caps">ISP</span>&#8216;s smtp is. I&#8217;ve tried the obvious and the net cafe staff are oblivious.</p>

<p>Tracepath ends in too many hops. I am getting tired of crap connections, I think I might need to head back to Finland or get a bloody shell, perhaps in Australia. With smtp, I could try employ a <a href="http://db.cs.helsinki.fi/~hendry/faqwiz/faqw.py?query=sendmail&amp;querytype=simple&amp;casefold=yes&amp;req=search">trick</a> mind, but that would mean putting my ssh key here on this net cafe machine&#8230;</p>

<p>This is the first Net cafe to use a proxy. I would always downloading putty onto a different machine if I liked the net cafe in my travels and this place in Bali was the first one that had a speedy 2nd download due to a proxy. I hope India&#8217;s Sify Iway have the brains to deploy a proxy (not to mention Firefox!).</p>

<p>Ubuntu: Gnome terminal seems to hang, ah, uxterm is here.</p>

<p>Oh yes, people have been bothering me about <strong>Wordpress</strong>. I should have got a test release out today with svn-upgrade, but my subversion repositry did a:</p>

<pre>
bilbo:501$ cat /tmp/ohshit
svn: DB_RUNRECOVERY: Fatal error, run database recovery
svn: bdb: Logging region out of memory; you may need to increase its size
svn: bdb: Recovery function for LSN 552 237437 failed on backward pass
svn: bdb: PANIC: Cannot allocate memory
svn: bdb: PANIC: fatal region error detected; run recovery
</pre>

<p>And so on. I goto #svn and <strong>eh</strong> <em>informs</em> me:<br />
<pre><br />
12:31 < eh> hendry:  maybe you should do what the error hint says before panicing?<br />
12:31 < eh> hendry:  you need to change some parameters in DB_CONFIG<br />
12:42 < eh> hendry:  read <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/log/config.html">http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/log/config.html</a><br />
</pre></p>

<p>eh?</p>

<p>Hmmm, I am none the wiser. So I am restoring from backups. This will take some time for the backup to slip into place as it&#8217;s about 1 Gig and I am too afraid to use rsync with the bust repo. I am getting a little insecure on Unix as I am forgetting commands (the lag too doesn&#8217;t help). Too much Indonesian sun?</p>
