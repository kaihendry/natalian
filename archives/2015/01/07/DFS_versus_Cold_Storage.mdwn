So I bought some wine & beer returning from the Philippines at <abbr title="Duty Free Shop">DFS</abbr> at Changi Airport.

# Wine

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16195511736" title="48.95SGD for Oyster Bay at Cold Storage by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7464/16195511736_b3f486446d_n.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="48.95SGD for Oyster Bay at Cold Storage"></a>

<abbr title="Duty Free Shop">DFS</abbr> prices correspond to that on their Website
<http://www.dfs.com/en/airport-singapore/featured-brands/oyster-bay/oyster-bay-sauvignon-blanc-2011-2012-75cl-70000138048>,
that is 36.20SGD for 0.75L of Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc.

I checked the price with Cold Storage, which was 48.95SGD. So that's almost a
30% saving!

# Beer

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16033890558" title="6pack Carlsberg at 16.70SGD at Cold Storage by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7471/16033890558_6035348747_n.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="6pack Carlsberg at 16.70SGD at Cold Storage"></a>

If you don't buy spirits, you can buy 2x3 cans of beer. 2x6.30SGD of the cheapest beer there, Carlsberg is 12.60SGD. A 6 pack of Carlsberg in Cold Storage is 16.70SGD, that's a 28% difference.

# So how much is tax?

In Singapore, duty on alcohol is $88.00 per litre of alcohol.

So for a 13% alcohol, 0.75L bottle of wine, it's $8.58. Goods & Services Tax is
$3.20 per bottle. 48.95-8.58-3.20=37.17SGD. So ignoring tax, <abbr title="Duty
Free Shop">DFS</abbr> is still a dollar cheaper than Cold Storage.

# What about the UK?

[Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc 75Cl at
Tesco](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=260222846) is
11.19GBP, which at best is 22.62SGD. That's with UK tax.

That's almost a 50% saving on Singapore duty free prices. Crazy.
