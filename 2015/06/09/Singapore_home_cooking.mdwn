Wow, so my wife and I now rent a HDB maisonette with a **kitchen** in Eunos.
After practically living without a kitchen in a Geylang studio for almost two
years.

Since my wife is pregnant I desperately wanted to stop eating out. The
Singapore food scene is cheap, fantastic & convenient, but after a while you
get sick of the mixed quality, the salt, the sugar and the grease. It's just
not healthy!

Now I wanted to record any useful information for Singapore home cooking in the
blog post, with my expat tastes.

# Fresh bread

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/19660595799/in/datetaken/" title="Bread from Werner&#x27;s Oven"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3776/19660595799_843a5f667c_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="Bread from Werner&#x27;s Oven"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Thankfully taken care of by my local German bakery Werner's oven, which is a
brisk 10 minute walk away. At 85cents a breakfast roll, I guess it's a luxury.
The Brotchen is authentic and their sausages are surprisingly good.

I'm contemplating doing home baking, but it's just another thing I would need
to learn and I'm told the process from start to finish takes 6 hrs and you need
to practice!

# Fresh fish

I'm told the best place is bloody Jurong fish market. Unfortunately it's both
very far from Eunos and I'm told you need to get there early, like 2AM early.

My local wet market Geylang Serai has lots of fish that seem to cater to Malay
tastes. The market is crowded and tbh, I basically only know Atlantic fish
well. There is a lot of fish I have no idea about there. I guess I should
meticulously try them all and record how it goes. You get sea fish, firm fish,
oily fish, bony fish. My favourite fish is undeniably Salmon. Surprisingly a
lot of fish in the market seem to be fresh water fish, which I don't like.

Cold Storage near my work in Lavender some times has offers on **whole**
Atlantic Salmon. Like ~40SGD for a whole Norwegian salmon. The logic is that
the customer who probably has NO IDEA how to cut up a fish, is to go home and
try cut a fish. The good news for me, is that I do have some experience cutting
up fish. Now I need a sharp Swibo knife please!

Ironically I was recommended by my new neighbour to buy fresh everything at my OLD
local super market Sheng Siong. Why?  It's the only shop in the east that is
24hrs and has a crazy amount of stock movement. Everything is always fresh.

# Fresh meat

I've been recommended [QB foods](http://www.qbfood.com.sg/) and [Ben's
foods](http://www.benfoods.com/). Unfortunately, both warehouse operations are
in ... bloody Jurong. MILES AWAY!

I'm told expat families typically stock up their freezer once a month with a
visit to Jurong. A round trip in Uber to Jurong from Eunos I estimate will cost
at LEAST 40SGD.  QB foods does delivery, so maybe I could setup a repeat order
once I know what I want.

Otherwise the only semi-decent butcher place that has good quality Aussie beef
steaks is the [Foodie Market in Tiong Bahru](https://www.facebook.com/FoodieMarketPlace). Easier to get to, but it's still
quite far out.

# Fresh vegetables

Thankfully the local Fair Price aka "ntuc" on Joo Chiat road has the cheapest
and best fresh produce from Australia I've seen. It's fraction of the price of
Cold Storage for Broccoli and grapes. Pity the rest of the supermarket kinda
sucks. Worse part is the service in my local branch is abysmal. There is often
long queues...

With any luck we should be getting a helper who I think will be instrumental in
taking the pain away from shopping at both Fair Price and Geylang Serai wet
market.

# Pasta

I haven't found a place that consistently does a wide selection of De Cecco
branded pasta, which I swear by. Would be nice if there was a place doing
decent fresh pasta, but I haven't found that place.

# Cheese

I haven't found a place I like yet. Especially since the prices are all quite
high. Expats tell me just buy a block of Australian cheddar (from Foodie
Market) and STFU. Guess I'm spoilt my [awesome Cornish cheeses](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/19316365891/).

# Spices

Best spice selection I've seen unsurprisingly is at
[Mustafas](http://www.mustafa.com.sg/). Their supermarket is actually pretty
good, but it's often busy and it just takes way too long to get in and out of
that store.

# Dry goods

Since I don't have a car, I think [Redmart](https://redmart.com/) suits us
best. Washing power, cleaning stuff, cereal, various cans of this and that. If
I had more time and energy I would shop cheaper places, but I value my time and
I'm willing to pay the premium.
