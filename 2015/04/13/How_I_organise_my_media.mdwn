Following up from [How I organise my
pictures](/2013/05/09/How_I_organise_my_pictures), there has been some
changes:

* I don't like running the proprietary blob of the Dropbox client or btsync
* static.natalian.org aka s.natalian.org is now on [AWS S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

From my laptop I run
[all.sh](https://github.com/kaihendry/media-organisation/blob/master/all.sh) to
grab my media off my iPhone or SDcard into YYYY-MM-DD folders.

Then I need to copy my local files to an external NUC using
[sync.sh](https://github.com/kaihendry/media-organisation/blob/master/sync.sh).
However since I keep running out of space when it comes to video media, I am
omitting videos nowadays, choosing to import directly to FCPX on a MBP.

# Images

Next I run
[flickr.sh](https://github.com/kaihendry/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/flickr.sh) to
upload from my NUC, which can take sometime.

# Videos

Currently with videos I attempt to import them all to FCPX for editing. And
then I try archive the the FCPX bundle using these scripts:
