Idea: Upstream publishes md5sums of releases which Debian can check with.

## Pros
* This makes it easier for maintainers
* Better security for users
* Piece of mind for upstream

## Cons

* Upstream will probably need some tool to generate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>
* Non-trivial to parse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>
* Version number mismatch
