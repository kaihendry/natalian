<p>This time last year I was in Pakistan. I&#8217;m very saddened to see the news this morning about the <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Strong_earthquake_hits_Pakistan%2C_north_India%2C_Afghanistan">Earthquake in the region.</a></p>

<p>I hope the good people I met there are safe. These people have enough hardship and for this to happen to them makes one despair.</p>
