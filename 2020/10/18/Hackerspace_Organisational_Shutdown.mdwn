[[!meta description="Thoughts of the Singapore Hackerspace on its impeding closure"]]

I came aware of the <a href="https://hackerspace.sg"><abbr title="Hackerspace.SG">HSG</abbr></a> [Organisation
Shutdown](https://hackerspace.sg/plenum/2020-10-20/) since I watch the
[hackerspace.sg](https://github.com/hackerspacesg/hackerspace.sg) repo.

The sad news was later announced on the [hackerspace.sg mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/g/hackerspacesg/c/nTWiUvvrG4s).

I've been reflecting on it whilst looking through [some old pictures on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=hackerspacesg).

* Incredible location - nightlife, tourists, great for food/tea
* Met a bunch of fantastic people
* Enthused me to stay in Singapore whilst visiting from Malaysia
* Great social atmosphere where we would often go to eat together at Beach Road Hawker centre
* Quiet room called "The Zone"
* On the second floor
* Ground floor was a great place to hang out and even have a [drink](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/8536224697/)

I set a Web cam there: <http://cam.hackerspace.sg/#2013-10-18>

# Space on King George's Avenue 2014-2020

The camera was moved <http://cam.hackerspace.sg/#2014-12-18>

Lavender is actually a pretty good area, but not nearly as lively as the previous location in Kampung Glam.

* Dark claustrophobic space with poor ventilation
* Not terribly easy to find
* Fourth floor: Up a couple flights of steps making it difficult to bump into people

I stopped visiting around 2016, and I cancelled my membership on 6 December
2017. This probably is more to do with the fact that I had become a father than
anything else. No time to hang out with the geeks.

However I do feel despite people's best efforts, some things did go wrong.

As a co-working space, it lacked proper "front desk" management. Some people
were really abusing the space imho. The feeling of the space became
uncomfortable for me at least.

# Thank you

Just want to say thank you to people who founded and ran the space for so long.

It was quite a respectable run!

# The future of "hackerspaces" in Singapore

Despite the incredible growth of co-working spaces in just about every corner
of downtown Singapore, nothing quite comes close to the feeling of the original
Hackerspace on Bussorah Street for me.

COVID-19 might be attributed to closure of Hackerspace.sg, but I'm thinking
there needs to be central accessible place for nerds to meet up and exchange
ideas, more than ever.

# Future proposals

Paying members should be listed and shown whether they are in good standing. In
my mind we were lacking a good membership system, though I'll be the first to
admit I've not made an effort to fix it.

The paid up members ideally would make decisions in an asynchronous / online
manner. No need for [frustrating synchronous plenums at the space as I moaned
about
before](https://natalian.org/2014/04/04/Better_organisational_decision_making/).

Without naming (real) names, there needs to be a way of basically kicking abusive
people out, as decided by paying members. Perhaps if you have three complaints
you are barred for a year? Something forgiving. AFAIK there is no clear policy
here.

To keep the place fresh and clean, it would be good if the space could
physically move at least once every two years. Unless it's in Kampung Glam. ;)
