<abbr title="Today I Learn">TIL</abbr> that Gravitraps around my Singaporean
neighbourhood are inspected once every two weeks.

The mosquitoes go inside the [Gravitrap](https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/nea-vox/index/why-is-nea-placing-mosquito-traps-outside-my-house-will-this-increase-my-chances-of-being-bitten-by-mosquitoes#.XPTELvi-F3o) to lay their eggs, but get trapped by a sticky
film, that gets replaced every two weeks.

The trapped and dead mosquitoes are then moved from the film to a vial, with a cut yellow plastic straw.

This sample will then be tested in a laboratory to check what type of mosquitoes they are, to determine their threat.

If the threat is high, increased fogging and inspections will be conducted by the <abbr

Many people do not really know what these traps are, and how they help conduct
the needed diligent science needed to control the mosquito pest. Often traps
are vandalised or just thrown away. 

I hope you now know better!
