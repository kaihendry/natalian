Since Singpore's COVID-19 Circuit Breaker, I am reliant on delivery services
for getting me stuff. I want to borrow an item off a friend, I can't expect him
to go to Singpost. Not that Singpost is a sane option without COVID-19. ðŸ˜‚

So enter "Grab Express", which is found confusingly under the "Delivery" button in the App.

Next issue is that it assumes I want to send something. Now I want the Grab express delivery guy to pick up the item. Now I need to fight the UI.

Next issue, make a mistake and hit back? Time to re-enter all the form details.

Doesn't seem to know my address, despite using Grab from my address 100s of times..

Once you filled in the form without making a mistake and resetting it, now you get to see the price!

Don't like the price and back out? Prepare to fill in the forms from scratch once again! ðŸ¤¦

# Order

Next issue is once you've been assigned a driver there is no way to share the
driver's whereabouts with parties concerned. Oh boy...

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2020-04-09/underway.png">

I put in the details of my friend and my helper, since I was going out for
exercise. Unfortunately the driver was trying to communicate with me and not
the numbers of the parties. There was an issue since I didn't realise the Unit
number was missing from my address.

# Price

Worst thing is there is no dynamic pricing with [GrabExpress
rates](https://www.grab.com/sg/express/). No supply / demand fluctuations.

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2020-04-10/grabexpress-bike-price.png">

Extra 2SGD for lunch time deliveries between 11.30am to 1.30pm.

Tbh I wasn't in a hurry. Anytime same day delivery would have been fine. Even
though it was a pricey 16SGD for a 10km trip, I kinda expected a more of an
[Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.sg/prime) experience where the driver might
go on a detour. But in this case, it seemed very similar to a Ride share
experience. Absolutely direct and fast.

Are there cheaper, slower options? With a better form and realtime live view of
the driver?

Or will it take another billionaire dollars of startup funding to
deliver?

## Ninja Van

I tried creating an account with <a href="https://www.ninjavan.co/">Ninja
Van</a>. Alarming they somehow have a worse form:

## Q10

<https://www.qoo10.sg> won't allow me to register with my email address:

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2020-04-09/invalid.png" alt="invalid email address">

And their captcha is damn hard.

## Uparcel

After registering with <https://www.uparcel.sg> and their site timing out (must be popular?), I am supposed to specify a time:

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2020-04-09/time-uparcel.png">

How about... **any time**? My friend and I are at home... **ALL DAY**!

After filling out the details of the form, they appear to charge 10SGD for same
day delivery. That's if I figure out how to pay them.

## Lalamove

Lalamove seems to have replicated [Grab's delivery
product](https://www.grab.com/sg/express/). Pricing model is exactly the same,
which is not competitive.

## Gogovan

Off the bat Gogovan fails the, "I want to collect" test. Gogovan assumes you are the sender.

So of course the courier uncle calls me up asking me whether I'm available now
for the pick up. Even though I put copious notes the Recipient info is who he's
collecting the item from!

It has a live map which is nice, though the Amazon Prime live map is so much
nicer and better executed.

Blu's App or process is very confusing. My first experience of their service
was this message via WhatsApp:

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2020-04-23/blu-first.jpeg">

The parcel reference cannot be used in the App **confusingly**:


<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2020-04-23/blu-fapp.jpeg">

After raising a support query with Blu, they called me to say that I should
ignore that message and wait for a **Your parcel is ready for collection**
message over WhatsApp. Heavens know what the UX is if you don't have WhatsApp!

So you actually do not need to use the App at all to collect. #goblutoday

<img src="https://s.natalian.org/2020-04-23/collected-blu.jpeg">

When collecting you have to sign with the recipient's name. I am not sure if
this would work at all if I delegated for someone else to collect on my behalf.
