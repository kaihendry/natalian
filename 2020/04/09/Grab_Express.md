[[!meta description="User Experience of Grab Express delivery service in Singapore"]]

Since Singpore's COVID-19 Circuit Breaker, I am reliant on delivery services
for getting me stuff. I want to borrow an item off a friend, I can't expect him
to go to Singpost. Not that Singpost is a sane option without COVID-19. ðŸ˜‚

So enter "Grab Express", which is found confusingly under the "Delivery" button in the App.

Next issue is that it assumes I want to send something. Now I want the Grab express delivery guy to pick up the item. Now I need to fight the UI.

Next issue, make a mistake and hit back? Time to re-enter all the form details.

Doesn't seem to know my address, despite using Grab from my address 100s of times..

Once you filled in the form without making a mistake and resetting it, now you get to see the price!

Don't like the price and back out? Prepare to fill in the forms from scratch once again! ðŸ¤¦

# Order

Next issue is once you've been assigned a driver there is no way to share the
driver's whereabouts with parties concerned. Oh boy...

I put in the details of my friend and my helper, since I was going out for
exercise. Unfortunately the driver was trying to communicate with me and not
the numbers of the parties. There was an issue since I didn't realise the Unit
number was missing from my address.

# Price

Tbh I wasn't in a hurry. Anytime same day delivery would have been fine. Even
though it was a pricey 16SGD for 10km trip, I kinda of expected a more of an
Amazon Prime experience where the driver might go on a detour. But in this
case, it seemed very similar to a Ride share experience. It was absolutely
direct and fast.

Are there cheaper, slower options? With a better form and live view of the
driver? 

Or will it take another billionaire dollars of startup funding to
deliver?
