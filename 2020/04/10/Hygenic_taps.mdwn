COVID-19 needs, I have been thinking about improving taps so that you don't
need to touch them! #socialdistancing

**Sensor taps** have a couple of issues:

1. They require electricity
2. In my experience they often do not work
3. There is no way to override them to work if the sensor fails
4. Of course they are much more expensive than a basic tap

Ideally there would be an inexpensive tap with a [mini hydro
turbine](https://www.coroflot.com/jinwoohan/Mini-Hydro-Turbine) powering a
reliable sensor to dispense water once your hands are near it. I haven't heard
or seen such a product. Have you?
