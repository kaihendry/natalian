COVID-19 needs, I have been thinking about improving taps so that you don't
need to touch them! #socialdistancing

You could conceivably wash your hands after touching a push down timed-flow tap,
though I find it awkward to do so.

**Sensor taps** have a couple of issues:

1. They require electricity
2. In my experience they often do not work
3. There is no way to override them to work if the sensor fails
4. Of course they are much more expensive than a basic tap

Ideally there would be an inexpensive tap with a [mini hydro
turbine](https://www.coroflot.com/jinwoohan/Mini-Hydro-Turbine) powering a
reliable sensor to dispense water once your hands are near it. I haven't heard
or seen such a product. Have you?

Foot controlled system; Pros: pure mechanics, no electricity. Kudos to my dear friend Felix for the link.

Cons: How the hell do you clean the foot trigger? Difficult with wheelchair users.

## Lever taps

Seen as the traditional option with the main drawback being you still have to
touch them with your elbow..

Big **disadvantage** is that they are not water saving since it won't turn off automatically!

Typically **single lever** unlike the ones above.

# NHS Hospital pattern


The Health Technical Memorandum 64 stipulates:

<blockquote>
Hospital pattern basins should be used in clinical procedures with safe,
integral thermostatically (TMV3 D08) controlled water and wall-mounted single
lever-action or sensor taps with concealed/ducted services.
</blockquote>

And that

<blockquote>
proximity sensor are now an alternative to lever-action taps.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Sensor-controlled fittings are ideally suited to control the flow of water at
scrub-up troughs and can offer the additional benefit of controlled runtimes.
The relationship between the taps and the trough is critical in order to avoid
splashing.
</blockquote>

Furthermore "Spray-type mixer taps are not recommended in healthcare premises;
therefore, the type of tap should be carefully selected to minimise the
formation of water droplets and aerosols."

Interesting the stipulates wall mounted fittings and basins **without tap holes**.

<blockquote>
The fitting and basin combination should be such that the water stream never
discharges directly into the basin's waste outlet</blockquote>
