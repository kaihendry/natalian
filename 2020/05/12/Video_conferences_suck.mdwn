Personally I find [synchronous video meetings agonising](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/1259378038103347200)!

# So why do people have video meetings?

* No way to meet or collaborate in person #covid19
* Stakeholders at the table
* Deadlines
* Forcing a decision
* Alignment
* Gets people to show up
* Conflict resolution
* Recognised as a medium to decide upon things collectively
* Express dependencies
* Express priorities
* Lowest common denominator, recognised as the way to do business in 2020
* Need to present some slides and talk over them
* Need to whiteboard some idea
* Get feedback from peers on some narrative
* Considered an open _unstructured_ forum by some

# So why do video conferences suck?

<blockquote>
A pointless meeting with five people that lasts an hour is not a waste of one hour of productivity, it's a waste of five hours.
</blockquote>

These are issues I've personally experienced. Hopefully over time people will
look at these issues and wonder how they were issues to begin with!

To begin with, presenting without seeing your audience is excruciating. Even
though it's a video conference, it's not practical to view participants faces
whilst sharing a screen.

## Chairing issues

No agenda, participants often aren't prepared.

Recording of decisions is done poorly. No minutes. No way to reference a decision or action.

Difficulty co-ordinating who speaks and for how long.

No time limit, so they basically can go on and on... until the next scheduled meeting.

## Technical issues

Poor audio. No decent microphone or headset. Noisy environment. Room with poor acoustic qualities (reverb).

Poor video. Poor lighting or camera. Distracting background.

Poor network. Packetloss. Latency. Difficult to diagnose where the issue lies between several participants.

Conferencing technology often requires centralisation to be efficient. It's
not peer to peer since many upload channels can only afford one video uplink.

Using wireless instead of wired as you can see for yourself is suboptimal:

<img title="wired is stable" src="https://s.natalian.org/2020-05-12/wired-lan-smokeping.png" alt="wired latency on a LAN">

Participants unable to mute their microphone.

Software unable to do noise suppression.

Not easy to share a desktop with common desktop anti-patterns of notifications interrupting focus.

Not easy to point or highlight / magnify elements on a shared desktop in real time.

Different software platforms have different features or limitations. For
example you can't mute people in Microsoft Teams. If you collaborate with an
Enterprise you might not be able to choose a better solution.

Difficult to diagnose issues. Try play a game between participants: Take turns
counting up as soon as hear the number. It's an awful experience.

# How to avoid video conferencing?

Don't host them like most <abbr title="Open-source software">OSS</abbr> projects.

However OSS often have properties that businesses do not:

* Strong individual contribution
* Better public documentation
* Operate in the public, transparently
* Assume good intentions
* Have a good way to reference decisions and data points
* **Importantly** the references (URLs) are used and cross referenced , e.g. [Github PRs issues comments](https://whatwg.org/working-mode#new-proposals)
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership> h/t [harish](https://twitter.com/harishpillay/status/1259431437855383553)
* OSS is based on passion and interest, business isn't
* Project members are truly committed
* Share the same knowledge, vision and idea
* Born distributed on the Internet
* Strong email etiquette <https://lkml.org/> and archives
* Acceptance of asynchronous mediums like <abbr title="Inter Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> or Slack

End result is that a majority of OSS do not need meetings.

# How to make video conferencing suck less?

Address the issues above! Solve organisational/management issues. **Take
responsibility**. I personally have the feeling that a lot of meeting
participants want to be "off record" to save their skins.

**Promote** a chair person. Arrange a queue or adopt "hand up" approach to indicate the participant has a point to make. Keep time!

**Promote** a note taker / scribe. Adopt good minuting practices and tools.
Have a Google doc or some other realtime pad so participants can collaborate
and add details. The note taker cannot be expected to be the presenter! This
responsibility for smaller meetings should probably fall on the chair person.

Solve technical issues; e.g. Supply a [Jabra
headset](https://www.jabra.sg/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve/jabra-evolve-20)
to staff and tell them to be wired!

**Record meetings**. Re-visit them. What could be better? Improve them!

**Reference recordings** and their products: actions/decisions.

Instead of "live" Webinars, record and edit presentation in advance and then
take questions after?

Attempt to solve the problem in a different way!
For example using [Standups](https://standuply.com/) for **alignment**, in an asynchronous medium like Slack.

Use **email**. However improving [posting
style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style) in software like Outlook is
impossible to do, so good etiquette OSS practices present in [mailing
lists](https://lkml.org/) cannot be adopted without software changes.
