Personally I find [synchronous video meetings agonising](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/1259378038103347200)!

# So why do people have video meetings?

* No way to meet or collaborate in person #covid19
* Stakeholders at the table
* Deadlines
* Forcing a decision
* Alignment
* Gets people to show up
* Conflict resolution
* Recognised as a medium to decide upon things collectively
* Express dependencies
* Express priorities
* Lowest common denominator, recognised as the way to do business in 2020
* Need to present some slides and talk over them
* Need to _whiteboard_ some idea
* Get feedback from peers on some narrative
* Considered an open _unstructured_ forum by some
* Better place to socialise, joke and to be more human

# So why do video conferences suck?

<blockquote> In-person conferences suck because they are inaccessible (e.g. if
you're poor and can't travel, or if you have a medical condition and can't
travel, or if you have family constraints and can't travel, or...). Video
conferences mostly just suck because of bandwidth and camera/microphone quality
constraints these days... At least, for meetings that are well run (with agenda
etc). But then I don't attend the ones that suck, so... :-) <cite>Ian
Hickson</cite> </blockquote>

These are issues I've personally experienced. Hopefully over time people will
look at these issues and wonder how they were issues to begin with!

I've found presenting without seeing your audience _excruciating_. Even though
it's a video conference, it's not practical to view participants faces whilst
sharing a screen.

## Chairing / moderation issues

<blockquote>
A pointless meeting with five people that lasts an hour is not a waste of one hour of productivity, it's a waste of five hours.
</blockquote>

**No agenda**, participants often aren't prepared. Agendas really should be at the
end of a sane URL: https://meeting.example.com/2020-05-14/subject

Recording of decisions is done poorly. No minutes. No way to reference a decision or action.

Difficulty co-ordinating who speaks and for how long. The moderator needs to step in!

No time limit, so meetings go on and on... until the next scheduled meeting.

## Technical issues

Poor audio. No decent microphone or headset. Noisy environment. Room with poor acoustic qualities (reverb).

<q>There [should be] only one audio stream, which is the current main content
to discuss, talk and reason about. There [should be] never multiple people talking.</q> &mdash; bizarrely every conference software I've used allows people to talk over each other.

Poor video. Poor lighting or camera. Distracting background.

Poor network. Packetloss. Latency. Difficult to diagnose where the issue lies between several participants.

Conferencing technology often requires _centralisation_ to be efficient. It's
not peer to peer since typical constrained upload channels can only afford one
video uplink. _Centralisation_ means conferences are typically not end to end
encrypted, making **video conferences a security concern**.

Using _optimal_ wireless instead of wired as you can see for yourself is _suboptimal_ compared to wired below:

<img title="wired is stable" src="https://s.natalian.org/2020-05-12/wired-lan-smokeping.png" alt="wired latency on a LAN">

Participants unable to mute their microphone.

Software unable to do noise suppression.

Not easy to share a desktop with common desktop anti-patterns of notifications
interrupting focus.  Not easy to point or annotate / highlight / magnify
elements on a shared desktop in real time.

Different software platforms have different features or limitations. If you
collaborate with an Enterprise you might not be able to choose a better
solution.

Difficult to diagnose issues. Try play a game between participants: Take turns
counting up as soon as hear the number. It's an awful experience.

# How to avoid video conferencing?

Learn from <abbr title="Open-source software">OSS</abbr> projects and do not
resort to video conferences!  Admittedly <abbr title="Open-source
software">OSS</abbr> is focused around **code reviews**, nonetheless they do
tend to produce amazing value / work.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No PMs, no agile, no scrum, no SLAs, no KPIs, no arbitary deadlines</p>&mdash; Alyssa Quek (@alyssaquek) <a href="https://twitter.com/alyssaquek/status/1260179756684845056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However OSS often have properties that businesses do not:

* Strong individual contribution
* Better public documentation
* Operate in the public, transparently
* Have a good way to reference decisions and data points
* **Importantly** the references (URLs) are used and cross referenced , e.g. [Github PRs issues comments](https://whatwg.org/working-mode#new-proposals)
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership> h/t [harish](https://twitter.com/harishpillay/status/1259431437855383553)
* OSS is based on passion and interest, business isn't
* Project members are truly committed
* Share the same knowledge, vision and idea
* Born distributed on the Internet
* Strong email etiquette <https://lkml.org/> and archives
* Acceptance of asynchronous mediums like <abbr title="Inter Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> or Slack

End result is that a majority of OSS do not need meetings.

# How to make video conferencing suck less?

Address the issues above! Solve organisational/management issues. **Take
responsibility**. I personally have the feeling that a lot of meeting
participants want to be "off record" to save their skins.

**Promote** a chair person / **moderator** or ensure the project manager is capable
of filling this role. Arrange a queue or adopt "hand up" approach to indicate
the participant has a point to make. Keep time! Own it!

**Promote** a note taker / scribe. Adopt good minuting practices and tools.
Have a Google doc or some other realtime pad so participants can collaborate
and add details. The note taker cannot be expected to be the presenter! This
responsibility for smaller meetings should probably fall on the chair person / moderator.

Solve technical issues; e.g. Supply a [Jabra
headset](https://www.jabra.sg/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve/jabra-evolve-20)
to staff and tell them to be wired!

**Record meetings**. Re-visit them. What could be better? Improve them!

**Reference recordings** and their products: actions/decisions.

Instead of "live" Webinars, pre-record and edit presentation in advance and
then take questions after? If you can't get good results in a recording, you
certainly won't achieve them live!

Attempt to solve the problem in a different way!  For example using _short form_
[Standups](https://standuply.com/) for **alignment**, in an **asynchronous
medium** like Slack or IRC.

<blockquote>The IRC room forces people to convert their fast thoughts into text. The
questions  were collected  and added  to the  main audio  stream context
according to the current moderator.<cite>20h</cite></blockquote>

Use **email with archives (decisions) you can reference**. However improving [posting
style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style) in software like Outlook is
impossible to do, so good etiquette OSS practices present in [mailing
lists](https://lkml.org/) cannot be adopted without software changes.
