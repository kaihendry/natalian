[[!meta description="Video meetings or Webinars are awful. Can they be better?"]]

Personally I find [synchronous video meetings agonising](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/1259378038103347200)!

# So why do people have video meetings?

* No way to meet or collaborate in person #covid19
* Stakeholders at the table
* Deadlines
* Alignment
* Gets people to show up
* Conflict resolution
* Recognised as a medium to decide upon things collectively
* Express dependencies
* Express priorities
* Lowest common denominator, recognised as the way to do business in 2020

# So why do video conferences suck?

## Chairing issues

No agenda, participants often aren't prepared.

Recording of decisions is done poorly. No minutes. No way to reference a decision or action.

Difficulty co-ordinating who speaks and for how long.

No time limit, so they basically can go on and on... until the next scheduled meeting.

## Technical issues

Poor audio. No decent microphone or headset. Noisy environment. Room with poor acoustic qualities (reverb).

Poor video. Poor lighting or camera. Distracting background.

Poor network. Packetloss. Latency. Difficult to diagnose where the issue lies between several participants.

Conferencing technology often requires centralisation to be efficient. It's
not peer to peer since many upload channels can only afford one video uplink.

Using wireless instead of wired.

Other participants unable to mute their microphone

Software unable to do noise suppression.

Not easy to share a desktop with common desktop anti-patterns of notifications interrupting focus.

Not easy to point or highlight elements on a shared desktop in real time.

Different software platforms have different features or limitations. For
example you can't mute people in Microsoft Teams. If you collaborate with an
Enterprise you might be able to choose a better solution.

Difficult to diagnose issues. Play a game between participants. Take turns
counting up as soon as hear the number.

## Issues with the medium itself

<blockquote>
A pointless meeting with five people that lasts an hour is not a waste of one hour of productivity, it's a waste of five hours.

Presenting without seeing your audience.

# How to avoid video conferencing?

Don't have them like most <abbr title="Open-source software">OSS</abbr> projects.

However OSS often have properties that businesses do not:

* Strong individual contribution
* Better public documentation
* Operate in the public, transparently
* Having a way to reference decisions and data points, e.g. Github issues comments
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership>
* OSS is based on passion and interest, business isn't
* People are truly committed
* Share the same knowledge, vision and idea
* Born distributed on the Internet
* Strong email etiquette <https://lkml.org/> and archives
* Acceptance of asynchronous mediums like <abbr title="Inter Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> or Slack

End result is that a majority of OSS do not need meetings.

# How to make video conferencing suck less?

Address the issues above! Solve organisational/management issues; e.g. Promote
a chair person. Adopt good minuting practices and tools. Like the W3C does?

Solve technical issues; e.g. Supply a [Jabra
headset](https://www.jabra.sg/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve/jabra-evolve-20)
to staff and tell them to be wired!

Instead of "live" Webinars, record and edit presentation in advance and then
take questions after?

Attempt to solve the problem in a different way!
For example using [Standups](https://standuply.com/) for **alignment**, in an asynchronous medium like Slack.

Use **email**. However improving [posting
style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style) in software like Outlook is
impossible to do, so OSS practices present in <https://lkml.org/> cannot be
adopted without software changes.
