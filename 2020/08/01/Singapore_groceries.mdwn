It has been five years since [Singapore home
cooking](/2015/06/09/Singapore_home_cooking/), time for an update!

# Coffee

I've tried other coffee roasters, though [PPP coffee](https://pppcoffee.com/)
(formerly Papapalheta) wins hands down for the light fruity Filter style I
love. 250g of [Beans](https://pppcoffee.com/collections/coffee/Beans) that I
grind at home is typically about 18SGD.

# Wine

Since wine has a fixed tax of about 8SGD, it might be a better idea to spend a
little more on wine. Nonetheless the best bang for buck for me and my tastes is South African wine from the African Marketplace.

* [White wine](https://africanmarketplace.sg/products/porcupine-ridge-cabernet-sauvignon)
* [Red wine](https://africanmarketplace.sg/collections/white/products/cederberg-cape-sauvignon-blanc-2018)

For example, hits the spot!

# Fresh Bread

Werner's Oven abruptly went out of business _before_ COVID-19!

Now Mr. Kneady's at The Bedok Marketplace is our substitute. Reaching 469560 is
a little awkward for us, however they bake a load and deliver to the
<https://www.cheeseshop.sg/> on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays around noon. I collect my
loaf up then!

# Fish

Our helper buys local Fish from Geylang Serai market. I prefer [the Alaska guys
products](http://thealaskaguys.com/index.php/shop) from cold waters. I love the taste of
scallops, crab, wild salmon, salmon eggs. Great products, that do however take
some effort to prepare properly. You don't want to screw up premium seafood!!

# Meat

Foodie Market Place on 313 Tanjong Katong Road. Their cheapest grass fed beef
is actually incredible value for money in my opinion. I treat myself to the
more aged "Ebony" cuts. Recently they have been sourcing chilled beef from
Argentina, which surprisingly competes very well with Australia.

# Fruit & Vegetables

Our helper sources our veggies from NTUC Fair Price.

# Pasta

Dececco from Foodie Market Place, so nothing has changed there.

# Cheese

I'm a regular at <https://www.cheeseshop.sg/>. Their Momolato ice creams are
also a regular favourite in our household. Best _value for money_ Cheese is the
black Vintage Reserve cheddar, pre-packed at 6.5SGD!

# Dry goods

Since COVID-19, Redmarts reservation process has frustrated us no end. Same
goes for Amazon Prime. We basically source all our dry goods from NTUC. Their
prices are competitive compared to the online options. [Our helper has a bike
and a bike trailer](https://s.natalian.org/2020-08-01/helperchariot.jpeg) to
carry bigger items like beer, rice and such.
